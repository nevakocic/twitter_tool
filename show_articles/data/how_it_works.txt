You need all files here; even gas.jpg :) 

So, nothing fancy and two steps to complete - 1st run python script and then procesing sketch.

>>it takes some time for both, since there are million links to grab from<<
(maybe you want to remove some?)

0. have to have internet connection
1. run python script to generate .csv file that processing will read.
In terminal, navigate to show_articles/data folder with final.py file and go:

python scrape.py

hit return. Wait to finish. Now there is updated output.cvs file and time to

2. run processing sketch. 
Run it and wait (this will also take couple of minutes). 
-that's it. Scroll and click on link to check full article online.

for anyone who is tweeting but still not sure how to use:

Open Terminal - type "Terminal" in Spotlight to open a terminal window on a mac.
Save the folder to desktop so you can navigate to there:

cd ~/Desktop/show_articles/data
To see what files are in the directory:
ls

You should see scrape.py listed. Now Type:

python scrape.py

hit return. Wait to finish. 
Now there is updated output.cvs file and time for processing.

Also, python script references 2 files, one with list of keywords based on which you will get the result, and one with links for scraping. Change them the way you want, but if adding any links, you will need to find rss feed for the site first, and then add that to list. Here is Zarah's list of web sites with the RSS column:

this is just FYI, which links are included.
