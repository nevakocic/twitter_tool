"|>>Expressive Portraits by Rosie Hardy Venture into the Stunning Realm of Fantasy|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150279|>>","|>>
For anyone who follows the work of young, talented photographers who belong to the Flickr community, Rosie Hardy is one name that comes up time and time again. Although only 23 years old, the Manchester, UK-based creative has been at the forefront of the movement of youthful, Flickr photographers who produce highly expressive images that venture into the surreal. With her captivating photos, Hardy has inspired the likes of Alex Stoddard and Phillip Schumacher. Since we last shared her work, the young photographer has enjoyed greater fame and recognition for her skill, even producing photos for big names like Maroon 5 and The 1975.
Looking at Hardy's stunning portfolio, it's not hard to understand her artistic success. Although diverse in their subject matter and composition, all of the images reveal a dreamlike, emotional world rendered in gorgeous tones. Her photos contain a compelling touch of fantasy, whether in the form of angel wings sprouting from the back of a young woman, lightbulbs hanging from the sky, or a courageous man facing off against a fierce lion.
When asked what made her pursue photography, Hardy—who describes herself as an ""escape artist""—wrote on her blog, ""I leap into these worlds which are in my head, which exist in songs and poetry and art. There's something else out there, there's a freedom which you can't grasp. . . So I take photos.""

"|>>Innovative Kids Room Features Hammock Seating and Modular Furniture|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150097|>>","|>>When the studio Ruetemple created a room in a Russian home meant for a young brother and sister, they didn’t take a conventional approach to the design. The two-storey space, called Interior for Students, needed to be a place for the kids to study, sleep, and hang out with their friends. So, architects Alexander Kudimov and Daria Butahina filled it with some fun details like a mezzanine hammock and a moveable cube. They built a fixed space for school work and dynamic areas for play using none of your typical furniture.
The lower level of the 108 square-foot room features a modular seating and sleeping cube on wheels. It can be arranged as a trio of sofas, as a long continuous line, or even closed up and made into a room within a room. Fixed office furniture occupies the other side of the space, and it includes desks, cupboards, shelves, and a staircase. All items are made from the same materials so that they appear as one cohesive piece of furniture.
The mezzanine level is devoid of flooring and has construction netting in its place. This creates an over-sized hammock that’s perfect for reading and relaxing. On its own, the upper level is too low to comfortably stand in, so Ruetemple devised a clever solution that gives this space a function. The innovative design is appealing to kids with clean, minimalist interior lines that feel grown up.

After one-of-a-kind wedding wildfire snapshots, spectacular photos of a bride and groom in an ice cave, and Jurassic Park-inspired nuptial photos featuring Jeff Goldblum, the latest wedding photos to go viral are these vibrant shots by Anchorage-based photographer Josh Martinez, who traveled by helicopter to Alaska's Knik Glacier with an adventurous bride and groom for one unforgettable portrait session.
During the photo shoot, the couple frolicked through lush meadows set against a backdrop of snowy mountains, explored icy fields, and even waded knee-deep into a glacial pool of stunningly blue water—ruining the wedding gown in the process. For such incredible photos, we think it may have been worth it!
Martinez, who works for Chugach Peaks Photography, shared with PetaPixel, ""The Bride & Groom gave me full creative freedom and in this case, that meant wading knee-deep into an icy glacial pool for Alaska’s ultimate trash-the-dress session! To access this incredible location, we explored the surface of the glacier by helicopter and located several pools of Windex-blue water that fit my vision perfectly. Our pilot landed on the glacier, and after fitting some safety gear we headed out to explore this epic world of ice, silt and water.""

"|>>Giant Hippo Sculpture Playfully Floats Along the Thames River|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150246|>>","|>> As part of Totally Thames, Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman recently installed a giant hippopotamus sculpture in the Thames river. The 70-foot-long wooden creature, playfully titled HipppoThames, was constructed over a small ship so that it would appear half-submerged in the water. Big googly eyes and hot pink nostrils make this giant animal look like a lot of fun. According to the artist, the piece was inspired by the hippos who used to inhabit the river during prehistoric times.
The conspicuous project is a continuation of the artist's signature style of creating massively unexpected sculptures inspired by everyday things, including Giant Slugs, a Rubber Duck, and a Sunbathing Hare. ""The purpose of setting my sculptures in the public domain has always been to give members of the public a break from their daily routines, to inspire conversation and to cause astonishment,"" explains Hofman.
HipppoThames will remain afloat at Nine Elms on the South Bank in central London through September 28, 2014.

"|>>Artists Spent Two Years Carving Intricate Woodcut of Stunning Landscape|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150176|>>","|>>
After nearly two years of meticulous work, Pittsburgh-based artists Paul Roden and Valerie Lueth—known collectively as Tugboat Printshop—have unveiled Overlook, a stunningly intricate woodcut that will be used to make limited edition color prints. The duo, who are known for their incredibly detailed pieces, have really set the bar with their most complex woodblock yet: a dizzyingly packed landscape filled with pine-dotted mountains, rolling hills, man-tilled fields, and layered groves of thick, lush trees.
To create Overlook, the artists first drew the design, then used small knives and chisels to carve into surface of the 28"" x 46"" block. After the key detail is finished, they will carve an additional 3-4 color blocks. Printed in layers using one block at a time, the final product will be a vibrant work of art with staggering detail and breadth.
The print will be available as a singular, diptych, triptych, or an entire room's worth of wallpaper that shows the vista extending endlessly. To snag your own limited edition print, be sure to pre-order Overlook on Tugboat Printshop's website.

"|>>Mirrored Suitcase Reflects Captivating City Scenes|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150172|>>","|>> Photographer Rui Calçada Bastos used a mirrored suitcase as the main focus to develop this engaging series, entitled The Mirror Suitcase Man, where images overlap in complex arrangements. Using light and reflections, Calçada Bastos captured moments in which a man carries a suitcase across a fragmented scene. The unique black and white project not only presents visually interesting compositions, but also offers viewers a small glimpse into the space behind the camera.
Through his lens, Calçada Bastos composed fantastic optical illusions and created a harmonious balance between two distinct spaces. The rectangular frame within a frame interrupts the scene and provides a striking combination of elements, from urban sidewalks and subway trains to patches of grass and cloudy skies. Though there are many recognizable objects within the photographs, Calçada Bastos provides no sense of certainty in each fleeting moment and viewers are left to wonder about the subject: Where is he headed? Is he coming or going? And where will he end up?

All together, this impressive 360 degree public artwork measures 23,500 square feet!
This mural is part of Os Gemeos’ (known separately as Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo) international series, Giants, and is their largest undertaking to date. It’s also the first time that their work will appear in Canada. The Vancouver Biennale helped to organize this project as part of their city-wide effort to convert urban landscapes into open air exhibitions across the city.
“We did not want a conventional two-dimensional wall that we had done before – we wanted something different, special and unique,” the brothers explain. “ As the proposed biennale has a strong connection with sculpture, we decided to find a place where the painting can be transformed, creating a dialogue between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional worlds.”
The completed mural is set to be formally revealed on Sunday, September 7 of this year.

"|>>My Modern Shop Spotlight - Kenji Croman's Breathtaking Wave Photography|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149985|>>","|>> Photographer Kenji Croman naturally discovered his love for the ocean at a young age while growing up in Hawaii. He spent his teen years boogie boarding and bodysurfing and experiencing the power of the crashing waves firsthand. Eventually, as an adult, Croman discovered that he could share these amazing experiences with others through photography.
With a waterproof camera strapped to his wrist, the adventurous photographer ventures out into the rough waters in order to capture nature at its best. He has only a few brief seconds to document the curling waves before they crash down upon him. In his bio, Croman states, ""I am constantly driven to get that better shot. It isn’t just about taking pictures for me anymore; it is being creative and trying to capture the beauty in nature in an artistic way.""
We're pleased to announce that all of the images featured in this post are now available as prints and canvases through our art store, My Modern Shop.

The project, developed by HG-Architecture | LIVE COMPONENTS, was recently commissioned by the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Korea. The large scale installation piece is intended to visually convey the idea that larger forms are generally composed of smaller elements, firmly constructed together to make the whole.

The project statement explains: ""Everything in nature is made up of components. It starts from basic components like atoms and molecules, and grows to bigger components like tissues and organs in order to construct a ‘live’ body. The artificial environment is quite the same. It all starts with basic components like points and lines, and grows to surface and finally construct a space.""
The piece appears differently depending on the viewer's perspective. Concave and convex curves create unusual spaces that move in wavelike motions across the room. Visitors are invited to investigate around the exterior and to walk underneath the construction to experience the details up close.

Victoria, British Columbia-based artist duo Andreas Kunert and Naomi Zettl create gorgeous, decorative wall installations out of stone. The husband and wife, who own their own stonework design, consulting, and sculpting firm called Ancient Art of Stone, specialize in building murals, fireplaces, and other stunning mosaic patterns from a wide array of rocks and pebbles.
The couple's installations are filled with an incredible amount of intricate detail, with hundreds of stones fitting together perfectly to form color-coordinated swirls. For such a hard, solid material, the designs that Kunert and Zettl create are astonishingly organic and graceful, flowing beautifully in spirals and waves across the surface of walls.
""Our inspiration flows directly from nature and the pure simple forms and rhythms that are inherent within the creative forces of the Earth,"" the duo writes on their website. ""Our medium is stone, which is both timeless and sustaining. . . Our creative works flow naturally and intuitively from the basic founding principles and building blocks of all creation, through sacred geometry.""

Many of us imagine giant, billowing creatures slowly floating by. Taking this fun a step further is Spanish creative and copywriter Martín Feijoó who brings the fantasies to life with a pen. His series, titled Shaping Clouds, features illustrations that are drawn on top of cloud formations. They represent the first thing that came to his mind once he saw their distinctive silhouettes.
Shaping Clouds started while Feijoó was travelling. “When I was a child I was told that clouds’ shapes were created by expert balloon twister clowns who live in the sky, so that they can keep entertaining children,” he explains on his Tumblr. “On my last trip to Mexico I remembered this and I started to photograph clouds on the road.”
The result of Feijoó’s journey is a whimsical series with detailed line drawings of a long necked platypus, big-headed duck, ferocious T-Rex, and more. It reminds us that even though we might look at the same sky, we all imagine something a little different floating up there.

If you haven’t eaten a McDonald’s Happy Meal in a while, you might’ve forgotten what they look like. But, even so, we can guarantee you that they don’t look like this. Artist Newt Clements has reimagined the iconic fast food packaging and replaced its standard bright red box with pop culture icons, movies, and television shows. They even come complete with a new toy!
Clements created a plethora of Happy Meal tribute boxes that include films like The Shining, shows like Breaking Bad, and celebrities like Nikki Minaj. And, of course there’s one dedicated to Grumpy Cat. It’s an amusing and well-crafted series that’s fun and subversive at the same time.
While some who see the unique Happy Meals “get” the joke, Clements has fooled others into thinking that they’re real. His “Ouija board” design caused a backlash when shared on Facebook, and it even earn him a place on Snopes. The rumor-busting site confirmed that McDonalds will not be producing this specially-themed Meal for Halloween this year.

For millennia, cultures around the world have celebrated the origin myth of of a giant animal—such as a turtle or elephant—supporting the world on its back. Beijing-based artist Ruilin Wang reinterprets that image in DREAMS-ark, an evocative series of sculptures that depict whales carrying entire landscapes on their backs.
Each large-scale work consists of a distinct type of whale paired with a different world. Rocky, alpine mountains sprout from the back of a sleek blue whale. A sperm whale balances a placid, icy pool on its back. From the back of a humpback whale rises a range of misty, tree-covered cliffs reminiscent of the mountains commonly depicted in traditional Chinese ink paintings.
Wang's series is a dreamy retelling of myth and folklore, reducing the entirety of the world into diminutive landscapes carried by whales that swim nebulously through the void. Both organic and architectural in form, the sculptures are a beautiful representation of nature, origins, and life.

To create each amazing piece, he layers together laser cut plywood into tactile pieces filled with various textures and shades of brown.
The thick, wooden sculptures are a fascinating display of the artist's illustration capabilities in a unique form. Intricately twisted curves and swirls form fantastic tales of animals fighting in the forest, elaborate sea serpents, and skeletons hiding in the closet. Energy and motion radiate from each whirling curl and undulation.
Tomsky is passionate about creating interesting visual narratives through his art. He explains, ""My personal work and illustrations for children are primarily about creating new worlds, unique characters to inhabit those worlds and to depict stories which bring them to life.""

Given his last name, you wouldn't immediately expect that Cambridgeshire-based artist Chris Wood's material of choice is delicate pieces of glass. Using small squares, Wood designs captivating arrangements and relies on light and reflection to influence his colorfully dazzling final products.
Wood directs optical projections towards each dynamic, wall mounted structure in order to control how light hits each piece. Through this creative illumination, his visually intriguing, geometric formations are quickly transformed into sparkling patterns of color and texture.
Wood explains, ""Glass is a material which allows me to exploit the aesthetic potential of light. Minimal structures, support simple arrangements of glass, which interact with light to create complex patterns of light and shade, which change depending upon the position of the viewer and the angle of the light source.""

Indiana-based folk artist Jamie Homeister uses delicate feathers as her canvas for intricate paintings of animals. Giving a nod to her Canadian heritage and Native American culture, Homeister meticulously builds up layers of paint on the fragile surface, depicting parrots, owls, eagles, finches, and even animals like foxes and bears. Many of her commissioned portraits are even painted on feathers that belonged to the birds depicted themselves, bringing the artwork one step closer to nature and wildlife.
""Featherwork is an incredibly humbling media,"" the artist says. ""The feathers splice, buckle, splinter and shred under the weight of paint. Layering them in my multi-feather formations is even more difficult to execute, as you have layers of light, airy, thinly threaded buoyancy.""

"|>>Nature-Inspired Gold Drawings Glimmer with Movement and Texture|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149716|>>","|>>
Artist Sarah A. Smith uses the unique medium of gold leaf to create glimmering, dynamic drawings that burst with movement and texture. Titled Gold Drawings, her collection of large-scale works commonly depict animals, landscapes, and other elements from nature in stunning, metallic swirls and shapes.
Smith uses a combination of metal leaf, corrosive, ink, and pencil blended together on paper to produce her shimmering scenes. To create her works, she dips her brush into a jar of diluted copper sulfate and brushes it across the shiny surface of the metal leaf, sparking an acidic reaction that oxidizes the elements.
The artist's use of this harsh chemical process—which corrodes, tarnishes, and destroys the gold material—makes a powerful statement about society's obsession with commerce and material goods. By treating the precious metal in such an unforgiving manner, Smith criticizes the impact that our excessive, consumption-driven ways have had on the environment.

A childhood fascination with his father’s collection of electrical and engineering components influenced his creation of these intricately-crafted and imaginative creatures. Oliver painstakingly collects objects like mechanical gears, old tins, eyeglass arms, and more as raw materials for his work. He then arranges items into fictitious insects, assigns them scientific names, and places the finished pieces into handmade wooden frames.
Oliver’s specimen-like treatment of his artwork is a nod to the Victorian tradition of insect collecting, which is the trapping and displaying of bugs for study. His work is fascinating from a distance and reveals its beauty up close. Make sure you carefully inspect these “bugs” so that you don’t miss out on seeing all of the interesting components that Oliver has amassed over time.

Titled The Preciousness of the Hunt, it was arranged by the Do Art Foundation and is located in the downtown area. Her painted work is not only eye-catching, but playfully interacts with the ground below; at certain angles it looks like the birds are emerging from the trees.
Using a combination of spray paint and brushes, Faith47 has done an incredible job of making this massive artwork look as effortless as a sketch. She layers opaque pigment and gestural marks that give the illusion of it being drawn with a pencil. This effect pairs nicely with the green wall it’s painted on as we see the colored brick peeking through the swans’ wings.

Illustrator Ben Chen's dark sense of humor and love of pop culture result in incredibly imaginative and clever illustrations. Chen, whose work we've previously shared, creates digital artworks that are filled with bold color schemes, cartoonish flair, playful twists, and an often morbid hilarity.
The unique illustrations offer a fresh and comical look at familiar situations, often combining characters from different movies, TV shows, and video games. Garfield the cat meets the Godfather in one unexpectedly brilliant, pop culture mashup. Other illustrations, such as the one depicting frogs exacting their revenge by dissecting humans, take a conventional premise, only to turn it completely on its head.

Cape Town-based photographer Anelia Loubser explores this idea in her series Alienation, which is a collection of portraits that capture people turned upside down. The black and white photographs are zoomed in and show us crystal-clear depictions of the eyes, foreheads, and hair in ways that we aren’t used to seeing.
With this slight shift, Loubser creates entirely new faces that are uniquely strange yet oddly familiar because of their human features; a quick glance could make it seem as if these pictures are of alien beings. It results in a beautifully eerie set of images that are wonderfully expressive thanks to forehead wrinkles and arresting sets of eyes. We’re able to appreciate how small changes in our vantage point can produce completely new, interesting compositions and stories.

"|>>Miniature Silhouetted People Playfully Interact With the Urban Landscape|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149604|>>","|>>Three years ago, the artist Pejac lived in a house with a lot of windows located in Valencia, Spain. He didn’t have any curtains hung, but used the crystal-clear view of apartment buildings and a security camera to experiment with paper and acrylic works on glass. Pejac's lack of privacy coupled with ample sunlight resulted in simple silhouetted pieces that play with scale and his surrounding urban landscape.
Although the artist is recognized for his outdoor street art, we can’t help but be captivated by these smaller, more intimate works. They cleverly integrate figures in situations that we’d never imagine anyone to be: standing on the top of a very tall and thin pole, swinging off a building’s roof, and fishing for birds flying in mid air. At first glance, these optical illusions seem to fool the eye into thinking that they’re real.
The playful works from the past have influenced one of Pejac’s more recent pieces, which features a window drawing of a tightrope walker. It’s a tribute to the legendary French high-wire walker Philippe Petit and commemorates the 40th anniversary of his journey between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City.

Canadian photographer Christopher Moloney brings the magic of cinema to life with FILMography, an ongoing art project that matches scenes from movies with their real-life, present-day locations. After printing out a black-and-white still from a film, Moloney holds up the print and snaps a photo of it aligned perfectly with the actual building, street, or or landmark behind it.
The stark juxtaposition of the movie still and the real-life location not only emphasizes the passage of time since the scene was filmed, but also calls attention to the astonishing fact that such ordinary places have been traversed by the likes of Anne Hathaway and Tom Hanks.
Since we last shared FILMography in 2012, Moloney has ventured beyond the iconic streets of New York City, traveling to places as distant as Rome and Naples to recreate famous movie scenes. Regardless of location, however, the fascinating series serves as a reminder of the spark of joy that a good film can bring to our everyday lives.

One of the most LOL-worthy corners of the internet is undoubtedly the subreddit Photoshop Battles, which is described as ""a place to have fun with everyone's favorite graphic software."" In an amusing example of a typical PsBattle, a Reddit user recently challenged fellow Redditors to create Photoshopped variations of the same image of an old woman using a puppet of herself to feed a squirrel. As one might imagine, the results are absolutely hilarious.
Some users chose to play around with the subjects of the photo, switching the old lady, the puppet, the squirrel, or even the bystander with each other. Others, inspired by the aesthetic of films like Pirates of the Caribbean or Michael Bay productions, added grandiose visual effects, such as in the cinematic shot of the elderly woman standing at the center of a whirlpool. A few Redditors even got meta on us, creating images that show the woman controlling an infinite line of puppets of herself, or being controlled by the squirrel itself in a circle of puppetry.
For more humorous demonstrations of imagination and Photoshop prowess, be sure to check out other PsBattles on Reddit.

"|>>Unique Engagement Ring Box Pirouettes the Ring Like a Blooming Flower|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149291|>>","|>>Marriage proposals can be scary, even if you know that the other person will say yes. How and where you’ll ask is always a factor, as well as where to hide the ring. After all, it’d be tragic if it were discovered beforehand. A slimline engagement ring box called Clifton solves this potential problem. Designed by Andrew Zo, it’s no bigger than the size of a wallet and slides into your pocket with ease. Plus, when you open the Clifton, the ring does more than just appear - it pirouettes into position. This is because a pop-up mechanism is meant to present the ring as if it’s a blooming flower.
Zo is a packaging designer by trade, and he first began developing Clifton as a student at Emily Carr University in Vancouver, Canada. He built a paper-based proof of concept in 2011 and over the past three years has refined it into the leather-bound product that we see today.
Clifton is available for purchase with a pricetag of $90. While that might seem like a lot, consider that the average engagement ring is $2,300; this means that the box only adds 4% onto the total expense. It could be seen as a negligible cost to make a once-in-a-lifetime event even more special.

"|>>Incredible Wheelchair-Bound Man Completes Ironman Triathlon Alongside His Twin Brother|>>","|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149321|>>","|>>
Last Sunday, 34-year-old Peder Mondrup became the first person with cerebral palsy to complete an Ironman triathlon, thanks to his own determination and the tremendous love and support of his twin brother, Steen. Using special equipment, Steen swam 2.4 miles while pulling Peder on a rubber raft, biked 112 miles with his brother seated in front of him, and ran 26.2 miles while pushing Peder in a wheelchair across hilly terrain. It took the incredible duo 15 hours, 32 minutes, and 48 seconds to complete the grueling KMD Ironman Copenhagen Challenge, but they finally crossed the finish line together amidst the bright lights and loud cheers of spectators close to midnight on August 24.
The twins, who call themselves Team Tvilling (""Team Twin"" in Danish), were born three months premature and weighing only 2.6 pounds each in 1980. Peder, who suffered a lack of oxygen that caused severe cerebral palsy, has been confined to a wheelchair for all of his life. This physical handicap hasn't held him back, however, as he's participated in a variety of marathons and races with Steen, with those efforts finally culminating in the spectacular completion of the extremely demanding Ironman.
""For the first time, I felt like the person I see myself as: a regular participant instead of 'somebody in a wheelchair,'"" said Peder. His brother shared, ""If I can give Peder the feeling of not sitting in a wheelchair for a few hours, then I will do whatever it takes! I feel like I am really lucky because he has caused me to see the positive in life and to not complain about everyday things. One thing is certain and that is that you never have and never will hear Peder feel sorry for himself.""
The twins, who joke that Steen got ""the legs"" and Peder got ""the brains,"" hope to pursue their dream of giving handicapped people the chance to feel the joy and pride of participating in races and other sports events. With their Ironman accomplishment only serving as the beginning of their journey, they have established the non-profit Team Twin Association, with the goal of establishing the world’s first triathlon training camps for the disabled in 2015. ""We are really excited about this next step for Team Twin,"" they said. ""The work has already begun and will now get our full attention.""

But, one small thing made it even better. Their baby boy was giving a thumbs up! You can clearly see in the hilarious photo that he’s saying that he “approves” of the ultrasound.
Since meancloth posted the picture on Reddit a mere few days ago, it’s gotten a massive 2.25 million views. The unusual and amusing gesture makes the baby Internet-famous before he’s even born. The little guy won’t be alone, though. If you notice in the top left corner, it says “Baby A,” which means he’s going to be a twin.

It was created in 2012 by FRM which is founded by Yugo Nakamura, recognised as one of the world’s most innovative web and interactive designers, and by William Lai whose work spans across product design and user experience, with a focus on physical products combined with the collaborative nature of the web.After two years they have developed FRAMED* 2.0 which it won't be just a display to showcase digital art but a platform,  a community hub and a marketplace where artists will have the opportunity to publish and sell their work.Behind of FRAMED* 2.0 there are major concerns about how digital art could spread itself around the Internet and into different artistic networks to be seen and collected through this beautifully designed canvas, and I believe that the right people is working on, as you may know Yugo Nakamura besides to be an award-winning Japanese software artist is the creator of FFFOUND!, yes the website and social image bookmarking service you used to use or still do to pick up some fresh visual inspiration, and that has been a great reference as a collectible and sharable based image platform and had an important impact about the way we discovered images online today. I highly recommend to read a recent conversation Filip Visnjic from CreativeApplications.Net had with William Lai about this, read here.FRM started yesterday a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter to raise funds in order to start this project and be able to commercialise this product if they reach the budget goal. They are offering nice offers for supporting this project from the lowest prices. To see that in one day they have duplicated the goal, it's a great response from the digital art community and everyone who believes on it.

You can follow Sabrina's work over Computers Club (here) and at Drawing Society (here) where she has a great archive of magic, celestial and architectonic based drawings. ""Visites Possibles explores the possibilities of creating 3D environments based on video images generated only by electronic signals. Inspired by architectural renderings and the idea of virtual tour, the video invites the viewer to visit its structure through specific parameters. The walls of the space embed doors which open and close randomly, thus revealing only glimpses of different electronic landscapes. While these landscapes are being revealed, they are also pushed away by the simulated camera movement, leaving only a limited time for contemplation. Consequently, the lateral scrolling of the image controls the visit, both spatially and time-wise. It also creates a sense of spatial continuity, which contrasts with the constant morphing of the space, changing into different configurations, without following any physical logic. Throughout the visit, ""entities"" arise and disappear regularly as if haunting this virtual environment. Visites Possibles also acts as a transitory space where multiple doors open on potential virtual experiences."" - Sabrina Ratté.SEE MORE INTO THE POST:|>>","|>>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c1PwhdbfZeU/U4RAq3XN98I/AAAAAAAAN6Q/gcbc2FLkvFA/s1600/Sabrina+Ratte%CC%81+TRIANGULATION.jp+09.png|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Through devices one has the possibility to literally peel-off and distinguish certain capacities as well as leave others in the dark. Data Drawings was produced during a 6 month residency at the Citè des Arts in Paris. I began to collect the bandwidth qualities of the WLAN in my studio with a simple iPhone App and wrote it down. Similar to a diary, but just with numeric information such as: Download: 972.0, Upload: 91.9, Ping 34 kB/s. I did this whenever I was physically in my studio. Sometimes I measured every minute, sometimes every hour. After a while, I came up with translating this informations onto a 3d grid in Rhino. Simultaneously I have experimented with drawing techniques of how to achieve something like all-over drawings which reflects back to the ideas of covering and multiplying. For each drawing I used the diagram I calculated on this specific day when I started to draw it. For me this technique allows to think about spaces in very blurred coherences, without depicting the place. On one hand you have this physical work (pencil and acrylic on paper), which is very abstract, on the other hand this abstract drawing has ""real"" numeric information behind every single line."" - Peter Jellitsch.

I use a series of offscreen framebuffer's to pile on different filters, and then feed the output of the final on screen framebuffer back to one of the earlier ones to complete the feedback loop (just like pointing a camera at a screen that is displaying the camera feed). The filters themselves are shaders written in GLSL.Since these are made with shaders running on the GPU, it's super fast and can run in real-time at 60fps or faster. It's pretty satisfying to shake your head around and throw off gobs of color, so eventually I'd like to get everything working in webGL as a little web toy so that other people can play with the parameters and experience it for themselves."" - Adam Ferriss.Into the post you can find a brief explanation of each video and the source Adam used to experiment with.

The work illustrates this vision as a series of temporal sketches, where the sketching process is presented in synchronized time with the audio from the original clip. Viewers are provoked to ask how computer vision differs from their own human vision, and what that difference reveals about our culturally-developed ways of looking. Why do we watch what we watch when we watch it? Will a system without our sense of narrative or historical patterns of vision watch the same things?Computers Watching Movies was computationally produced using software written by the artist. This software uses computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence routines to give the system some degree of agency, allowing it to decide what it watches and what it does not. Six well-known clips from popular films are used in the work, enabling many viewers to draw upon their own visual memory of a scene when they watch it. The scenes are from the following movies: 2001: A Space Odyssey, American Beauty, Inception, Taxi Driver, The Matrix, and Annie Hall."" - Benjamin Grosser.

It is basically an online pixel pattern painter, where the user has to create his/her own patterns and paint with. All the patterns are created into a 32 x 32px box which is the maximum size for the brush and in that space you can create whatever you want, I think 32px is enough for a pixel pattern tool, it's the double size than a favicon and per example you can reproduce a lot of already existent icons from the internet whose fit perfect on that space. To build your own patterns it's an interesting and creative process, one has to care quite a lot about the edges of the pattern because WendyPaint only offers one way painting mode which is by dragging the pattern and doing a continue stroke if you keep the brush going on, and one click equals one pattern, so edges are important on here. Once the pattern is done you can edit it using some rotating and flipping features and save them in different modes, but what it's really nice it's that you can also create others using little code through the colour pattern generator and modulator which works using i, x, y, w; variables and with that it's possible to create infinite geometric and glitchy patterns and gradients very quickly, some examples into the post. Another good point is that the users have the option to share the patterns they do and build a public huge archive of patterns, good online based concept. It also has a Stream where there are all the public pieces, make sure you click on the checkbox when saving your painting as it is hidden by default.

    Our celestial home just got a whole lot bigger -- on the astronomical map, at least. This week, a team of astronomers re-charted the supercluster of galaxies that includes the Milky Way, finding it to be 100 times bigger in volume and mass than previously thought. In a new study, published in the journal Nature, the researchers chronicled the motions of the galaxies, in order to determine the “gravitational landscape” of the local Universe. The team named the enormous supercluster Laniakea – Hawaiian for “immeasurable heaven.""

    Formula E Racecar  

KatherineLegge.com/Amlin Aguri 

In the April 2014 issue of Popular Science, we exploded the view of the racecar designed for Formula E -- the first fully electric, global racing championship. Back then the first round seemed so distant. But now drivers are only a week away from hitting the track inside shockingly quiet vehicles that can top 60 mph in about 3 seconds.
One of those drivers is British auto racer Katherine Legge, the first woman confirmed for Formula E. Popular Science is happy to report that we've partnered with Legge for her inaugural race -- which means we’ll be going along for the ride. At the launch of the Formula E series in Beijing on Saturday, September 13, Legge's helmet will be emblazoned with our logo as she competes against 19 other drivers. She also plans to post exclusive, on-the-ground reports here at PopSci.com. (Look for those starting next week.)
Why are we fans of Legge? Because she’s a fan of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. For example, Legge is a STEM ambassador for the Girl Scouts to remind young girls that they can succeed in any field if they work hard and believe in themselves.
We couldn’t agree more, which is why we’re hoping to give Legge a little extra boost out on the racetrack. And that's where you come in.
Formula E gives its fans an unprecedented chance to help out a driver through a system called FanBoost. In short, the three drivers with the most votes from registered fans get more speed. More specifically, they each get a 5-second, 30-kilowatt boost, ramping up their cars' 150 kilowatts of power to 180 kilowatts just before the race begins.
Fans can vote for only one driver, and voting closes on the day of the race. So be sure to cast yours before September 13. (Go Legge, go!)
Visit FanBoost to give Legge a leg up on the track.

    Gerd Liebezeita & Elisabeth Liebezeita  

Beer lovers: there may be more to your brew than dazzling citrus overtones or a subtle chocolatey aroma.
The authors of a new study went to a local supermarket in Germany and picked up 24 brands of beer, including the 10 most popular in the country. In the lab, they found plastic particles and other debris in everything they tested. The study was part of a larger investigation of plastic microfibres that are turning up all over the natural world as larger plastics break down. (In June, Illinois became the first state to ban plastic beads in cosmetics, which are thought to be one source of the pollution.)
How the plastic ended up in beer is an open question. The paper notes than some of the brands claim to use only spring water in their products, and sand particles often found around springs also showed up under the microscope. Malfunctioning equipment, unclean bottles, and even contaminated barley and hops are all possible sources. Beer may be filtered with activated charcoal, asbestos, wood chippings and other materials that could carry plastics.
The study only gets more shudder-worthy when it turns to the other debris they found.
""Workers in breweries lose, as any other people, the outer part of their epidermis,"" they write.
Scales of exfoliated skin were found in both small and larger chunks, along with bits of glass and even an ""almost complete"" dead insect.

    Other filth  

    Non-synthetic particles in beer: (A) insect remain, order Thysanoptera; and (B) glass shard. Scale = 3.1 mm.  

    Gerd Liebezeita & Elisabeth Liebezeita  

The study concludes that none of the samples contained enough plastic or other materials to present a danger to the public. The important takeaway, the authors write, is that if these tiny plastic bits are making it into beer, they have penetrated the human environment.

Here's a roundup of the week's top drone news: the military, commercial, non-profit, and recreational applications of unmanned aircraft.
Through A Scan Eagle Darkly
The ethics of drone warfare are coming to the silver screen. “Good Kill,” a film starring Ethan Hawke and directed by Andrew Niccol, focuses on an American drone pilot based in Nevada. The film debuted at the Venice Film Festival today. The director hopes it will spark debate. Here’s hoping some of that debate addresses the mental health challenges that come with being a drone pilot.
Charges Against Prismatic Pilot
In August, a Dutch tourist flew a drone over Yellowstone National Park’s resplendent Grand Prismatic Spring. Unfortunately, the drone crashed into the 160-degree-Fahrenheit waters, where it remains today. The National Park Service banned drones from parks in June, and as a consequence the pilot, Theodorus Van Vliet, has been charged with $5,000 in fines and/or six months in jail and/or five years on probation. Under the same policy, the National Park Service has charged at least two another drone pilots.
Ram Versus Sky Cam
While the National Park Service is worried about drones hurting wildlife, perhaps it’s the drones that should fear the animals. In the below video, YouTube user Buddhanz1 flies a drone in search of a ram, and the ram headbutts the quadcopter right out of the sky. Watch the video:

Red Skies
At the Peace Mission 2014 exercises, forces from China, Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan all worked together in trial counter-terror practice. Together with absent member Uzbekistan, these countries form the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Together they tested normal operations incorporating drones. From our story:
Perhaps the most high profile Chinese weapon was the use of a Pterodactyl UCAV, considered the equivalent of the US MQ-9 Reaper, which bombed an enemy ""terrorist"" target with an ATF-10 ATGM.  The usage of a UCAV in what was actually a fairly conventional mechanized operation is something not yet well integrated in American operations of the equivalent aircraft. It also suggests that Chinese doctrine may be more risk-friendly in employing unmanned platforms against well-armed opponents than American drone use has been so far.
Drone Home
A local news station reports that a University of Texas student flew a drone over the university’s first home game. Police detained and questioned the student, but the murkiness of drone law leaves it unclear whether there's an existing law the student violated.

    Iraqi Army Soldiers In Light Armored Vehicles, 2007

When Iraq’s American-equipped army fled their posts in Mosul last June, they left that American equipment in the hands Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the attacking violent insurgent group. Since then, the U.S. Air Force destroyed some of the captured vehicles. Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, wonders if there’s a better way to stop stolen equipment from working. He proposes “kill switches,” like those found in iPhones, as a means for keeping American arms, given to allies, from working in the hands of enemies.
Here’s the key idea from Zittrain’s article:
It is past time that we consider whether we should build in a way to remotely disable such dangerous tools in an emergency. Other technologies, including smartphones, already incorporate this kind of capability. The theft of iPhones plummeted this year after Apple introduced a remote “kill switch,” which a phone’s owner can use to make sure no one else can use his or her lost or stolen phone. If this feature is worth putting in consumer devices, why not embed it in devices that can be so devastatingly repurposed—including against their rightful owners, as at the Mosul Dam?
Through email, Popular Science spoke with Zittrain about how these proposed killswitches could work, and what they would mean for arming allies in the future.
Popular Science: Cell phone kill switches work in a world filled with cellphone towers and internet connections--things that are rare on battlefields. I know you mention satellites, but what kinds of infrastructure do you think a kill switch would require?
Jonathan Zittrain: Some [military] hardware already relies on communications with a home base perhaps thousands of miles away. For example, remotely piloted drones. The technology used to securely direct drones might be usable for other instruments of war. Essentially, the more sophisticated and communications-based, such as relying upon military-grade GPS, the less of an incremental change a kill switch would represent.
PS: What kinds of military gear do you see as likely kill switch candidates?
JZ: Medium and heavy weaponry, including tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, helicopters, and jets.
PS: What safeguards could prevent an armed non-state actor from ""jailbreaking"" their killswitch-enabled MANPADS [Man Portable Air Defense Systems], tanks, or rifles?
JZ: No safeguard is foolproof, and physical possession of the gear in question is often thought of as ""game over"" from a hacking perspective. But if we see the problem in terms of time and effort to break the lock, rather than ""can it ever be broken,"" there may be useful ways of integrating this technology, especially when balanced against the costs of misuse of the weapons should they be completely unsecured. (Right now we might depend on such things as batteries that naturally expire and are hard to replace, or other maintenance that an adversary won't be in a position to do.)
Steven Bellovin at Columbia has done a lot of thinking about this problem for nuclear weapons, which need to be hardened against use should they fall into someone's wrongful possession. He's written up his thoughts here.
One could also imagine an expiration date requiring renewal with a code or signal, so that no adversary could hack the switch itself and render the weapon useless even if it hadn't been stolen. At most the hacker could allow the weapon to continue operating past its due date.

PS: Many small arms in current use are decades old if not older. Would you support retroactively adding kill switches to these before distribution, or are kill switches more for advanced equipment?
JZ: I see them as more useful for more advanced equipment. With the world awash in small arms, it seems harder to make a dent in that supply.
PS: With kill switch-equipped weapons, do you think the United States or others would be more likely to arm friendly non-state actors?
JZ: This is a distinct possibility, and could mean that kill switches would, as a second-order effect, lead to more arms being sold or given to parties. If the worst uses can be foreclosed -- or we convince ourselves that they are -- it changes the downside risk of providing the arms to begin with.
PS: Kill switches come with a major trust issue. While America might promise killswitchable weapons to an allied army so that an insurgent can't use them, what assurance would the ally have that the kill switch wouldn't leave them vulnerable?
JZ: That assurance may already be in question. Any secret kill switches already in use would presumably be used rarely in order not to eliminate that trust. Here, stated up front, a recipient knows the conditions by which the arms are transferred. The easy case is the recipient possessing the kill switch; the more difficult is the providing country having it; the most radical would be for the UN Security Council or some other group to have to come to consensus to trigger the switch.

    Working out burns calories, while making smelly skin microbes.

Chris Callewaert wants to solve body odor, starting with your gym clothes.
He and a team of European microbiologists have tackled a stifling mystery that permeates locker rooms and laundry hampers across the world: Why does gym gear reek even days after a workout?
A fair assumption would be that some fabrics trap more sweat than others, but perspiration on its own is sterile and does not produce foul odors.
Instead, pungent bacteria from our skin grow more readily on certain workout shirts, namely those made from synthetic textiles like polyester, according to new research from Callewaert and his colleagues at Ghent University in Belgium.
The scientists had 26 healthy individuals – 13 men and 13 women – participate in a spinning class, while wearing T-shirts made from natural or synthetic fibers. After the exercise, the shirts were stuffed into plastic bags and stored in the dark, akin to tossing gym clothes into a musty locker. After 28 hours, an independent panel of odor connoisseurs judged that the polyester shirts stank worse than cotton-based ones.
Skin germs feast on chemicals in sweat, turning them into pungent odor compounds, which the bacteria subsequently “fart” out.
Next, the researchers swabbed the shirts’ armpit regions for bacteria. Skin bacteria produce many of the scents connected to bad body odor -- and armpits are microbe havens.
To understand just how prolific bacteria are on our bodies, grab a ruler and pen. Draw a square one centimeter by one centimeter on your forearm. Around 100 bacteria live inside that square. In contrast, an identical square on your armpit, navel, or toe web spaces carries 10 million bacteria.
The most common known cause of malodor is a family of skin microbes in the genus Corynebacterium; however, the scientists couldn’t spot any on sweaty gym gear.
Rather they found that soiled polyester shirts wound up harboring more Micrococci bacteria, a type of odiferous germ, than cotton shirts. The result was surprising because Micrococci don’t generally grow in pits.
“As part of a separate, ongoing study, we’ve screened over 200 people, and found very low levels of Micrococci present on armpit skin,” says Callewaert. “Something about sweat-filled polyester enriches these sour-smelling bacteria.”

Skin germs feast on chemicals in sweat, turning them into pungent odor compounds, which the bacteria subsequently “fart” out. While natural textiles absorb this stench-filled water, Callewaert and his colleagues suspect that the funky juice pools in the microscopic spaces in between synthetic fibers, creating a great environment for bacteria to flourish.

To explore this idea, the team took a few pungent species of bacteria and tried growing them in Petri dishes coated with seven different fabrics: polyester, acryl, nylon, fleece, viscose, cotton, and wool.
The results were mixed. Cotton grew very few smelly germs, akin to earlier findings, while the microbes continued to swarm over polyester.
Synthetic nylon was a great refuge for Propionibacterium acnes, a species of bacteria that causes acne and foot odor. Natural wool supported every germ tested, while the scientists found one fabric – viscose – where bacteria didn’t grow.
This preliminary study could help inform clothing makers on how to create less smelly apparel.
“Many manufacturers have started adding antimicrobials, like nanosilver, to their clothes,” says coauthor Nico Boon, a microbial ecologist at Ghent University.
Such chemicals eliminate germs indiscriminately, meaning the good germs disappear with the bad. “This could potentially throw off our immune systems,” Boon continues. “We should manage and control the existing microbial community, so that we steer the germs in the way that we want, instead of killing everything,”
To keep garb from trapping workout odor, he and Callewaert recommend clothing hybrids, where the fabric coming in contact with armpits is made from cotton. The rest of the shirt could be synthetic fabric, which accumulates less heat and feels more comfy.
The researchers published their work in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

The American Southwest may be headed for a “megadrought,” an arid period longer than any in recent memory.
A megadrought is the name for a decades-long dry spell. Researchers have known since 1998 that megadroughts can occur in the region. Under normal conditions, dry periods of several decades or more come once or twice in a millennium, but the changing climate has made the danger much more imminent. Now, a new study has determined there is a 50 percent chance that a drought as long as 35 years will occur in the next century. And the chances of another decade-long drought are as high as 80 percent.
In order to understand the conditions that lead to these rare multi-decade dry periods, researchers went into the field to study the traces that ancient weather patterns leave behind. “You go up into the mountains and these beautiful places where moisture limits growth to take samples,” Dr. Toby Ault, lead researcher of the study, tells Popular Science.
In dry places, plants grow slower and the gaps between their annual tree rings are shorter. By matching up modern tree rings with ancient wood -- such as beams from pre-Columbian Native American desert dwellings -- researchers can track annual moisture patterns going back centuries. That’s an important part of how they know the Southwest has been through megadroughts before, as well as how often they've happened.
Plus, climate models have long predicted the Southwest will lose water as the Earth warms, and the prolonged drying period predicted for the coming years looks eerily similar to the periods that preceded the sustained dry periods of the past.
“This pretty robust feature of climate change models loads the dice toward droughts and megadroughts,” Ault says.
Decade-long droughts came about once a century in the pre-climate change world. Today, California and Arizona are parched. An ongoing 15-year drought is sucking dry the region’s reservoirs and drying out its forests, leading to a range of problems, including immediate concerns about water shortages in Tucson, Phoenix, and even Las Vegas.
There is some uncertainty as to the relationship between the region’s current struggles and climate change, but this drought points to what the whole Southwest may have to deal with if droughts become more widespread and longer-lasting. A megadrought could include New Mexico and Texas, and last as long as 35 years.
However, Ault says a megadrought in our lifetimes would not have to mean devastation for the American Southwest.
“Some of our best evidence of droughts comes from tree rings,” he points out. “That means some trees grew during dry periods. A megadrought doesn’t spell death and destruction for all creatures. Less water does not mean no water.”
Ault says he hopes his findings will encourage state and local water conservation groups to deal with the danger of water scarcity becoming the norm. Advances in water conservation and management have prevented the current Arizona drought from becoming as bad as the Dust Bowl, a shorter dry spell that devastated American plains agriculture during the Great Depression in the 1930s.
“As long as we accept that we are a clever and adaptable species -- and I think all evidence points to us being a clever and adaptable species -- we can mange this,” he says.

Library of Congress 
This year marks the centennial of the start of the First World War. To honor it, Popular Science is combing through our archives to bring you the best of our original war coverage--from the emergence of tanks, airplanes, and other military tech, to essays examining the relationship between war and eugenics. 
The first post in our ""Remembering The Great War"" series comes from the September 1914 issue of Popular Science, which is the first time the magazine discusses the war in Europe. In a series of essays, scientists probed various aspects of war, and came down strongly in favor of peace. “Everywhere the energies of men are diverted from scientific and social progress to destruction,” we wrote. Essay topics included the futility of war as a means of creating peace (by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie), the (im)morality of war (by philosopher William James), and even speculations that sending a nation's fittest men to be slain in war could lead to the degeneration of society. The latter essay was authored by the noted ichthyologist, eugenicist, and peace activist David Starr Jordan, who wrote,

Those who fall in war are the young men of the nations, the men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, without blemish so far as may be—the men of courage, alertness, dash and recklessness, the men who value their lives as naught in the service of the nation. The man who is left is for better and for worse the reverse of all this, and it is he who determines what the future of the nation shall be.

(For context: Eugenics, or the idea that societies could improve themselves by weeding out people who are  genetically ""less fit"", was a concept that was accepted by many scientists in the early 1900s. The idea later lost steam as scientists realized that harmful mutations are naturally introduced into the population all the time ... and after forced sterilizations, euthanization, and mass murder made eugenics seem a lot less beneficent.)
The most compelling essay from the September 1914, excerpted below, was written by psychologist James McKeen Cattell (originally in 1912, and republished for this issue) and explores the relationship between war and science.
Science And The International Good Will
By James McKeen Cattell for Popular Science, April 1912. Republished September 1914.
Science with its applications has been one of the principal factors leading to peace and international good will. Science, democracy and the limitation of warfare are the great achievements of modern civilization. They have advanced together almost continuously from the beginnings of the universities of Bologna, Paris and Oxford in the twelfth century to their great triumphs in the nineteenth century and the present promise of their complete supremacy. It may be urged reasonably that science is the true cause of democracy and that science and democracy together are the influences most conducive to permanent and universal peace.
The applications of science in industry, agriculture and commerce, in the prevention of disease and of premature death, have abolished the need of excessive manual labor. It long ago became unnecessary for the great majority of the people to be held in bondage in order that a few free citizens might have education and opportunity, and slavery has been gradually driven from the world. The vast progress of scientific discovery and invention in the nineteenth century has reduced to a moderate amount the daily labor required from each in order that all may be adequately fed, clothed and housed. The death-rate has been decreased to one half; the ensuing lower birth-rate has freed nearly half the time of women and reduced proportionately the labor of men. The period of childhood and youth may be devoted to universal education, and equality of opportunity can be given to all. It is no longer needful to depend on a privileged class to conduct the affairs of government and to supply men of performance. Those selected from all the people as most fit can be given the preparation and opportunity needed to enable them to become leaders, and every one can take an intelligent share in political affairs and in appreciation of the higher things of life.
Science is the true cause of democracy, and science and democracy together are the influences most conducive to permanent and universal peace.
In giving us democracy science has made its greatest contribution to the limitation of warfare. It must be admitted that a democratic people may be inflamed into a mob mad for war; but this is not likely to happen in the case of a war of policy or of aggression. In the past wars have been more often due to the ambitions, difficulties and intrigues of kings and princes than to the passions of the people, and the decrease of wars has been largely a result of the establishment of constitutional governments and of the legalization of the methods of conscription and taxation. If a declaration of war or an ultimatum leading to war were subject to a referendum, the vote being taken not too promptly, and if the estimated cost of the war were collected in taxes in advance, there would not be many wars.
We are still far from having a true political and social democracy. The production of wealth has increased rapidly; but we have not learned to distribute it justly or to use it wisely. The education supplied by our schools is inadequate and inept. We may be confident that a complete democracy will be the strongest force for peace that the world has seen. Even now the great mass of the people, most of them having some education and some property, are the true guarantees against wanton war. A king can no longer summon his nobles and the chiefs gather together their retainers to invade a foreign country. A war which, with' its accompanying pestilence and famine, would reduce the population of a country to one half, as in the case of the thirty years' war, is now almost inconceivable. And this we owe to social and political democracy, which in turn we owe to science.
As a result of scientific progress and invention, the law of Malthus has been reversed. The means of subsistence increase more rapidly than the population. The sinister voluntary limitation of childbirth, which may give rise to racial deterioration and actual depopulation, is unnecessary. As population increases under a given condition of culture, the number of men of genius and talent competent to make the labor of each more efficient increases in proportion; as their inventions are of benefit to all, the means of subsistence tend to increase as the square of the population. As the level of education and culture is raised, and as democracy is perfected, so that each is given opportunity to do the work for which he is fit, the wealth and means of subsistence increase still more rapidly. The law of Malthus and the law of diminishing returns, like the law of the degradation of energy, may ultimately prevail, but not in any future with which we are concerned. The population of a civilized country, in which science is cultivated, need not be limited by famine, pestilence or war. Over-population and the need of expansion by conquest are obviated by democracy and science; the cause of war which may be regarded as inevitable and legitimate is thus abolished. In providing adequately for the subsistence of an increasing population, science has made a contribution to peace the magnitude of which cannot be easily overstated.

Another great service for peace to be credited to science is the development of commerce, travel and intercommunication. Steam and electricity are handmaids of peace. Trade disputes and the misadventures of missionaries, travelers and immigrants may serve as causes or pretexts of wars, but the balance of commerce, travel and immigration is large on the side of peace. With the existing commerce among the nations, each dependent on every other, a war of any kind does injury to all. A nation at war destroys its own property throughout the world, and all the nations suffer. A neutral nation can no more afford to countenance a needless war than mobs burning its own cities and killing its own citizens. In New York, London, Berlin and Paris are business houses and representatives of every country in the world. How could any nation wish to destroy or to permit the destruction of these cities? . . .

Science has given us democracy, it has given us ample means of subsistence, it has given us commerce and intercommunication, and these three achievements are the principal factors which have lessened warfare and will eventually lead to its complete abolition. Other contributions of science, though less momentous, are by no means unimportant. Warfare is now in large measure applied science, and this tends towards its decrease. Wars between nations with scientific equipment and savage and barbarous peoples are no longer waged on equal terms and are of short duration. The extermination, despoliation and subjugation of the non-Caucasian races may be the world's great tragedy, and in so far as some of these peoples are able to adopt our science there will be a readjustment which may be written in blood or may be a triumph of common sense and justice. However this may be, the invincibility that science has conferred on the western nations has made them safe from attack and invasion, and while it may on occasion have led to wanton aggression, it has, on the whole, limited warfare. If we call to mind the centuries of invasion and threats of invasion by North-men, Ottomans and Saracens, we can appreciate the value of the means of defense which science has given to the civilized nations.
The invincibility that science has conferred on the Western nations has made them safe from attack and invasion, and while it may on occasion have led to wanton aggression, it has, on the whole, limited warfare.
The making of warfare an applied science by the western nations and by one eastern nation has tended also to prevent war between nations so equipped. When war is a game of skill rather than of chance, it is likely to be' undertaken only after careful consideration of the conditions and consequences. The cost is enormous and must be carefully weighed. The interests of the money lenders are usually on the side of peace and become increasingly so as war continues. If war does occur between two great nations it is likely to be of short duration. It can not drag on through tens of years as formerly. Its horrors are also reduced; non-combatants are not so much concerned, and soldiers suffer less from disease—far more dreadful than violence—owing to the shorter duration of wars and to hygiene, medicine and surgery. It may be hoped that science has accomplished, on the whole, more for defense than for aggression; torpedoes, mines, submarines and aeroplanes are more effective for protection than for attack. The cost of modern armaments is so immense that this in itself will lead to their limitation and to the settlement of difficulties otherwise than by appeal to arms.
There is a psychological aspect of modern scientific warfare, which tends to discredit it. The heroism and the bravery, the excitement of personal contact and the exhibition of personal prowess, the romance and the occasional chivalry, are largely gone. Men cooped up in battleships or displayed like pawns on the field are not much greater heroes to themselves or to others than workers in a mine exposed to nearly equal danger. Officers under constant instructions from the seat of government and telegraphing their orders from a point of safety fall to the level of ordinary men of affairs. Tin soldiers will not forever stir the imagination of children in the nursery. Providence is on the side favored by the money lenders and having the best organized commissariat. War becomes brutal and disgusting; at its best like the business of the hangman, at its worst like infanticide.

"|>>Prostate Cancer 'Organoids' Could Help Personalize Treatment|>>","|>>http://www.popsci.com/article/prostate-cancer-organoids-could-help-personalize-treatment|>>","|>>
    Cancer vs. Organoid  

    Slides of a patient’s tumor (right) and of an organoid made from that tumor (left).  

    Dr. Yu Chen  

When it comes to treating cancer, all tumors are not created equal. Within every cancer type – whether it be in the bone or the breast – each patient has a unique set of mutations that cause their cells to be cancerous. That means therapies need to be personally tailored to each individual in order to be most effective.
Hoping to make this kind of personalized medicine a reality, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have successfully grown six functioning prostate cancer ‘organoids’ outside the body. Derived from biopsies of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the tiny organic 3-D structures are comprised of thousands of cells, grouped together and organized like an organ. Their tissues are also highly similar to the biopsy samples from which they came, making them almost like tiny replicas of prostate cancer in a petri dish. The researchers hope to use these organoids as tools for testing new cancer drugs in the future.
They're almost like tiny replicas of prostate cancer in a petri dish.
According to Dr. Yu Chen, the lead researcher on the project, organoids are relatively new to medicine but are proving to be promising for research, as they mimic human organs. “We have all different kinds of cells in our body, but within each organ, there are also multiple cell types,” Chen, an assistant attending physician at MSK, tells Popular Science. In the lab, organoids continuously generate these different cells, just on a much smaller scale.
Chen says that with his lab's cancer organoids, the cells are a bit more monotonous, since the cells in a tumor are mostly the same. However, each cancer organoid is unique from one another, containing the distinct mutations from each patient’s cancer.
Now the idea is to create a whole lot of these tiny prostate cancer organoids, to determine which medicines work best for different subsets of patients. “If we have the mutations from a large number of patients, this will help us discover which mutations correlate to drug sensitivity or drug resistance in the laboratory,” Chen says, who noted that the organoids could be used to test multiple drugs at the same time.
Meanwhile, experts predict that more and more patients will have their cancer genomes sequenced in the future, revealing which mutations are turning their cells against them.  And with the information gleaned from organoid testing, researchers will be able to know which mutations respond better to certain treatments, making therapy options a lot more personal.
The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell.

To combat this, the UK Design Council recently launched the Inclusive Design Hub to highlight the advantages and importance of incorporating inclusive design principles. The video highlights several triumphs of inclusive design, including the Ford Focus, in which designers mimicked the challenges that older people face while driving a car, then included their findings into the final design. The point, they urge, is to not design for a checklist, but to empathize with the full spectrum of potential users. As the University of Cambridge’s “Inclusive design toolkit” site states, “Every design decision has the potential to include or exclude customers. Inclusive design emphasizes the contribution that understanding user diversity makes to informing these... keep reading

Natalya Stanko rose to the challenge and brought an educated foundation to build the research on top of. Visually’s own Jess Bachman worked closely with her to categorize and come up with a visual language to organize all the offenses deemed worthy of death.

With the vast majority of marketers using content to build their brands, it’s no wonder marketers are expanding the ways their content gets delivered. Experiential marketing is nothing new – from billboards to sandwich boards, brands have a history of engaging consumers outside their homes. In recent years, however, out-of-home media spend has been among the fastest-growing categories – global spend is expected to exceed $40Bn by 2018, according to PWC. The large canvas, the emergence of digitally powered signage, and the hyper-local nature of outdoor advertising have all contributed to the growth. Still, while the format may be known, today’s top marketers are innovating they way they use experiential marketing to tell their brand stories. Connect your experiences. Like all digital campaigns, the best ones move seamlessly across screens, formats, and platforms. When... keep reading

They are there to provide the players with information about what is going on in the game, or post-game statistics. In Roller Coaster Tycoon for example, the data visualizations helped players make informed decisions about roller coaster design, or track park expenditures and balance their budget. This approach helps players to get better at the game and provides some interesting interfaces for players to explore. Digital Dreams has taken a different approach to integrating data visualizations with Metrico. They have built a game set entirely in an infographic world. The puzzle platformer looks a little bit like what an infographic designer’s dreams (or maybe nightmares) must look like when they have an impending deadline. The game is based on a simple principle: player movements can also cause changes in the game level. For example, jumping multiple times... keep reading

I’m here to talk about interactive graphics – the cool new kids on the block when it comes to visual content – and why they’re the next big thing in content marketing. What makes an Inter-ACTIVE? Interactive graphics, or ‘interactives’ for short, are like the Transformers of visual content: They can take on a variety of forms. You can find an interactive that’s a microsite, dashboard, or a map, to name a few. But at the core, they’re all visualizations that allow viewers to explore the information presented for themselves. By definition, interactives engage viewers in a very active way – and that engagement can be incredibly powerful to marketers.

The study split its sample of organizations using content marketing into two groups: ‘leaders’ – the top 35% most effective companies – and ‘followers’ – the bottom 65%. The link between content marketing success and content marketing measurement is far from a coincidence. Measurement is a must. Using data and metrics to gauge marketing success is far from a new idea. However, it is a bit more involved when it comes to content marketing, which can include social media content, native advertising content, and custom-created visual content such as Infographics, Motion Graphics, and Micro-content. The key is to not only measure, but to do it right. In... keep reading

As part of the 2014 Biennale Interieur, curatorial group Space Caviar is hosting what they call a ""demolition workshop"" in the Belgian town of Kortrijk.  Set in a derelict school building condemned to demolition after the workshop has ended, the project aims to ""construct alternative routes into and through the building, most significantly a new staircase,"" and to explore new forms of improvisatory navigation through architectural space by way of ""inventive deletions or modifications."" Think of it as applied topology in the tradition of Gordon Matta-Clark. [Images: Some internal views of the Broelschool, via Space Caviar]. You have only a narrow window of time in which to apply to join one of two teams in the exercise, however—that is, you only have until Friday, September 5, to express interest.  To apply, send an e-mail to martina (at) spacecaviar (dot) net with the subject ""Broelschool Demolition Workshop,"" including your name, contact information, hometown, and professional CV or PDF portfolio, and you need to indicate which of the two teams you are hoping to join. Those teams are, and I quote:  TEAM DÉRIVE (5 people) will construct alternative routes into and through the building, most significantly a new staircase. Through sensitive and inventive deletions or modifications, this group will create shortcuts and reveal hidden aspects of the original architecture, as well as foreshadowing some of the future architectural plans for the building site. Using the building itself as a source of reusable material, the workshop will both predate the destruction and celebrate the transition of the school.TEAM TIMELINE (5 people) will create a graphical layer on top of the existing architecture that offers a unique chronology of the domestic space over the last half-century. Blending quotes, data, diagrams, graffiti, and way-finding, the timeline will lead visitors to explore the nooks and crannies of the school in search of the steps in the story of the home.  However, in your email you must also then complete these sentences in no more than 100 words: a) My first memory of home is... b) My current home is... c) My ideal home is...  The workshop itself takes place September 23-28. [Image: ""Splitting"" (1974) by Gordon Matta-Clark, courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art].

"|>>Through the Cracks Between Stars|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/through-cracks-between-stars.html|>>","|>>[Image: Trevor Paglen, ""PAN (Unknown; USA-207),"" from The Other Night Sky]. I had the pleasure last winter of attending a lecture by Trevor Paglen in Amsterdam, where he spoke about a project of his called The Last Pictures. As Paglen describes it, ""Humanity’s longest lasting remnants are found among the stars."" Over the last fifty years, hundreds of satellites have been launched into geosynchronous orbits, forming a ring of machines 36,000 kilometers from earth. Thousands of times further away than most other satellites, geostationary spacecraft remain locked as man-made moons in perpetual orbit long after their operational lifetimes. Geosynchronous spacecraft will be among civilization's most enduring remnants, quietly circling earth until the earth is no more.Paglen ended his lecture with an amazing anecdote worth repeating here. Expanding on this notion—that humanity's longest-lasting ruins will not be cities, cathedrals, or even mines, but rather geostationary satellites orbiting the Earth, surviving for literally billions of years beyond anything we might build on the planet's surface—Paglen tried to conjure up what this could look like for other species in the far future. Billions of years from now, he began to narrate, long after city lights and the humans who made them have disappeared from the Earth, other intelligent species might eventually begin to see traces of humanity's long-since erased presence on the planet.  Consider deep-sea squid, Paglen suggested, who would have billions of years to continue developing and perfecting their incredible eyesight, a sensory skill perfect for peering through the otherwise impenetrable darkness of the oceans—yet also an eyesight that could let them gaze out at the stars in deep space.  Perhaps, Paglen speculated, these future deep-sea squid with their extraordinary powers of sight honed precisely for focusing on tiny points of light in the darkness might drift up to the surface of the ocean on calm nights to look upward at the stars, viewing a scene that will have rearranged into whole new constellations since the last time humans walked the Earth. And, there, the squid might notice something.  High above, seeming to move against the tides of distant planets and stars, would be tiny reflective points that never stray from their locations. They are there every night; they are more eternal than even the largest and most impressive constellations in the sky sliding nightly around them.  Seeming to look back at the squid like the eyes of patient gods, permanent and unchanging in these places reserved for them there in the firmament, those points would be nothing other than the geostationary satellites Paglen made reference to.  This would be the only real evidence, he suggested, to any terrestrial lifeforms in the distant future that humans had ever existed: strange ruins stuck there in the night, passively reflecting the sun, never falling, angelic and undisturbed, peering back through the veil of stars. [Image: Star trails, seen from space, via Wikimedia]. Aside from the awesome, Lovecraftian poetry of this image—of tentacular creatures emerging from the benthic deep to gaze upward with eyes the size of automobiles at satellites far older than even continents and mountain ranges—the actual moment of seeing these machines for ourselves is equally shocking.  By now, for example, we have all seen so-called ""star trail"" photos, where the Earth's rotation stretches every point of starlight into long, perfect curves through the night sky. These are gorgeous, if somewhat clichéd, images, and they tend to evoke an almost psychedelic state of cosmic wonder, very nearly the opposite of anything sinister or disturbing. [Image: More star trails from space, via Wikipedia]. Yet in Paglen's photo ""PAN (Unknown; USA-207)""—part of another project of his called The Other Night Sky— something incredible and haunting occurs. Amidst all those moving stars blurred across the sky like ribbons, tiny points of reflected light burn through—and they are not moving at all. There is something else up there, this image makes clear, something utterly, unnaturally still, something frozen there amidst the whirl of space, looking back down at us as if through cracks between the stars.  [Image: Cropping in to highlight the geostationary satellites—the unblurred dots between the star trails—in ""PAN (Unknown; USA-207)"" by Trevor Paglen, from The Other Night Sky]. The Other Night Sky, Paglen explains, ""is a project to track and photograph classified American satellites, space debris, and other obscure objects in Earth orbit.""  To do so, he uses ""observational data produced by an international network of amateur satellite observers to calculate the position and timing of overhead transits which are photographed with telescopes and large-format cameras and other imaging devices.""  The image that opens this post ""depicts an array of spacecraft in geostationary orbit at 34.5 degrees east, a position over central Kenya. In the lower right of the image is a cluster of four spacecraft. The second from the left is known as 'PAN.'""  What is PAN? Well, the interesting thing is that not many people actually know. Its initials stand for ""Palladium At Night,"" but ""this is one mysterious bird,"" satellite watchers have claimed; it is a ""mystery satellite"" with ""an unusual history of frequent relocations,"" although it is to be found in the eastern hemisphere, stationed far above the Indian Ocean (Paglen took this photograph from South Africa). As Paglen writes, ""PAN is unique among classified American satellites because it is not publically claimed by any intelligence of military agency. Space analysts have speculated that PAN may be operated by the Central Intelligence Agency."" Paglen and others have speculated about other possible meanings of the name PAN—check out his website for more on that—but what strikes me here is less the political backstory behind the satellites than the visceral effect such an otherwise abstract photograph can have.  In other words, we don't actually need Paglen's deep-sea squid of the far future with their extraordinary eyesight to make the point for us that there are now uncanny constellations around the earth, sinister patterns visible against the backdrop of natural motion that weaves the sky into such an inspiring sight.  These fixed points peer back at us through the cracks, an unnatural astronomy installed there in secret by someone or something capable of resisting the normal movements of the universe, never announcing themselves while watching anonymously from space.

"|>>Weather is the Future of Urban Design|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/weather-is-future-of-urban-design.html|>>","|>>[Image: From a newscast about Istanbul's recent tornadoes]. It's hard to resist a story where urban design is blamed for creating tornadoes. But the recent cluster of ""freak mini-tornadoes"" striking Istanbul offers an anomaly in search of an explanation, and the newly built outer edges of the metropolis are potentially to blame.  According to Ed Danaher at NOAA's Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, speaking to the Hürriyet Daily News, ""we know that tornadoes are exotic to Istanbul, like snow is to Florida."" That article go on to suggest, however, that these tornadoes ""are possibly one result of the city’s rapid urbanization,"" and that such a claim can be made based on their conversations with other meteorological researchers working at NOAA.  As their headline states bluntly, ""Istanbul tornadoes [are] a 'result of urbanization'."" This conjures up frankly outrageous images of a city so sprawling—and so thermally ill-conceived—that huge masses of air at different temperatures are now rising into the sky to do battle, violently colliding like mythological titans above the city to generate the surreal tornadoes now ripping through the neighborhoods below.  Weather might be the future of urban design—but the rest of the news story actually includes no such quotations or any relevant evidence that would back up such a claim. They refer to climate change and its effects on regional humidity, of course, but, oddly enough, there is otherwise no attempt to back up the opening statement. [Image: Photographer uncredited; via the Hürriyet Daily News]. But... But... It's so tempting to speculate. Beyond just being clickbait, this vision of suburban sprawl inadvertently churning the skies with the introduced turbulence of tornadoes, and thus destroying the landscape like some twisted instant karma of the atmosphere, is too awesome not to entertain for at least the length of a cup of coffee.  What weird old gods of weather have Istanbul's architects accidentally awoken? As streets and buildings continue to bulge outward into the forests and hills of the region, what else might their spatial activities unleash?  (Originally spotted via @urbanphoto_blog.

"|>>Powers of Quarantine|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/powers-of-quarantine.html|>>","|>>[Image: Liberian security forces implement ""a quarantine of the West Point slum, stepping up the government’s fight to stop the outbreak and unnerving residents."" Photo by Abbas Dulleh/AP, via Al Jazeera America]. Of Forcible Blockades and Military Isolation A neighborhood-scale quarantine was forcibly imposed on the slums of Monrovia, Liberia, yesterday to help prevent the spread of Ebola.  Using makeshift roadblocks—consisting, for the most part, of old furniture, wooden pallets, and barbed wire, as everyday objects were transformed into the raw materials of a police blockade—authorities have forcibly isolated the densely populated neighborhood of West Point from the rest of the city.  Unsurprisingly, however, poor communication, over-aggressive law enforcement tactics, and general misinformation about the nature—even the very existence—of Ebola has led to local resistance.  Al Jazeera reports, for example, that ""police in the Liberian capital have fired live rounds and tear gas to disperse a stone-throwing crowd trying to break an Ebola quarantine imposed on their neighborhood."" But they were perhaps simply trying to defend themselves against a badly communicated onslaught of police wielding batons and machine guns, and they would be doing so whether Ebola was in the picture or not.  [Image: Neigborhood-scale quarantine; photo by Abbas Dulleh/AP, via Al Jazeera America]. Ubiquitous Quarantine But this is only one of the most recent—and one of the more extreme—examples of the spatial practice of quarantine reappearing in the news in recent weeks. At the end of July, for example, the Chinese city of Yumen was partially quarantined due to an outbreak of bubonic plague, as parts of the city were ""sealed off"" from the neighborhoods around them; and the ongoing Ebola outbreak has led to involuntary quarantines being implemented at nearly every spatial level, from the individual to the city to entire international regions.  In the latter case, recall that just last week a cordon sanitaire was enforced in the international border regions of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to stop people possibly infected with Ebola from crossing the borders. As the New York Times described this action, ""The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is so out of control that governments there have revived a disease-fighting tactic not used in nearly a century: the 'cordon sanitaire,' in which a line is drawn around the infected area and no one is allowed out.""  This spatial technique for managing the spread of microbiological life has ""the potential to become brutal and inhumane,"" the paper adds. ""Centuries ago, in their most extreme form, everyone within the boundaries was left to die or survive, until the outbreak ended."" [Image: Enforcing quarantine; Photo by Abbas Dulleh/AP, via Al Jazeera America]. Resisting Quarantine Yet resistance to quarantine is nearly as ubiquitous as attempts to implement it. The very notion of involuntary quarantine is important to emphasize here: this is something that must be spatially imposed on people who have not chosen to bring this condition upon themselves.  Read this dramatic description from the Times, for example, depicting the moment at which involuntary government quarantine is revealed: Soldiers and police officers in riot gear blocked the roads. Even the waterfront was cordoned off, with the coast guard stopping residents from setting out in canoes. The entire neighborhood, a sprawling slum with tens of thousands of people, awoke Wednesday morning to find that it was under strict quarantine in the government’s halting fight against Ebola. The reaction was swift and violent. Angry young men hurled rocks and stormed barbed-wire barricades, trying to break out. Soldiers repelled the surging crowd with live rounds, driving back hundreds of young men.Involuntary quarantine can inspire this type of reaction at any scale. Consider the panic-stricken family who forcibly raided a hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in order to free an Ebola-stricken relative who, they had come to believe, was being held against her will; she later died, but not before passing her infection on to others. Or consider the Nigerian nurse possibly exposed to Ebola while caring for patients who nonetheless ""skipped quarantine,"" either out of a desperate sense of self-preservation or due to sheer ignorance of the dangers of her actions.  ""Don't Touch The Walls!"" Somewhat incredibly, though, the deliberate breaking of quarantine can also occur not out of survivalist panic or concern for one's own medical safety, but simply for the purpose of looting. Some of the descriptions here are jaw-dropping, with raiders actually breaking into Ebola wards to steal ""property like tents, tarpaulins, buckets, hospital beds, mobile phones and shoes among other things,"" literally all of which could bear traces of Ebola and thus spread the contagion elsewhere. The New York Times had a particularly chilling example of why not to steal from Ebola wards when it ran this haunting sentence two weeks ago: ""'Don’t touch the walls!' a Western medical technician yelled out. 'Totally infected.'"" Yet, even in the West Point quarantine zone, misguided acts of theft are rampant: ""Residents stormed through"" the quarantine zone, we read, also in the New York Times, ""running off with a generator and supplies like mattresses, some soaked with the blood of patients who were believed to have Ebola. "" Yet, in a situation where even the hospitals are considered to be ""death traps,"" where the walls themselves are ""totally infected"" with Ebola, the designation of involuntary and militarily enforced quarantine boundaries is taken to mean the designation of a kind of urban sacrifice zone, a place where patients can be fatally off-loaded and the disease tragically but successfully contained. From this point of view, getting out of the quarantine zone becomes a top priority.  Residents of West Point have even protested that ""their community, they believed, was becoming a dumping ground for Ebola patients,"" and that quarantine was simply a spatial excuse for putting victims all in one place, uninfected neighbors be damned. ""In all,"" we read, ""residents tried to break through the barricade three times on Wednesday, Col. Prince Johnson, the army’s brigade commander, said Wednesday evening by phone. His soldiers had fired in the air, he said, but he would not comment on whether they had also fired into the crowd.""  [Image: A ""quarantine house"" in Pennsylvania; courtesy of the U.S. Library of Congress]. Powers of Quarantine Who has the power to quarantine? Where does this power come from—especially in a Constitutional democracy like the United States—and where exactly are this power's limits? Does it have any? Nicola Twilley and I explored these questions last week for the New Yorker, looking at, among other things, the Constitutional implications of quarantine powers. As we point out in that piece, there is an ethically troubling overlap between the notion of the quarantined subject, spatially isolated often against his or her will, and the liminal figure of the ""enemy combatant"" who potentially never faces the prospect of a legal trial whilst being indefinitely detained. In both cases, extrajudicial detention can occur on the ground of suspicion alone—presumed guilt or infection—rather than legal or medical certainty. In fact, writing as a coauthor on two Congressional Research Reports from 2005, legal theorist Jennifer Elsea commented on both of these categories: of the combatant held by the state without rights or legal access to resistance, and the medical subject unable to protest his or her segregation due to being held in a state of involuntary quarantine.  As we see massive international quarantine zones enforced at gunpoint throughout West Africa, and as suspected Ebola cases pop up everywhere from Johannesburg to California, it is well worth discussing where these spatial powers come from, who controls them, and when and where quarantine has reached its limit. The Return of Quarantine Indeed, as Twilley and I suggested back in 2010 during the ""Landscapes of Quarantine"" design studio and exhibition at New York's Storefront for Art and Architecture, quarantine is a decidedly pre-modern spatial practice that is nonetheless experiencing a contemporary comeback.  Confronted with widespread antibiotic resistance and increased global air travel that can bring diseases like Ebola to every global metropolis in a matter of hours, quarantine is part of ""a 14th-century toolbox"" that ironically looks perfectly at home in the 21st century.  [Image: Quarantine station, Pennsylvania; courtesy of the U.S. Library of Congress]. Given all these examples of resistance, confusion, and the violence often necessary to impose spatial isolation on people only suspected of bearing a disease, we suggest in the New Yorker essay that quarantine becomes something of a spatial fiction, always and permanently on the verge of collapse. Its premise is a fantasy; the imaginary boundaries it seeks to defend are legally loose and physically porous.  Nonetheless, for all its apparent instability, quarantine offers a necessary fiction of separation and control at a time when the boundaries between health and contagion have become so vertiginous and blurred. (Note: Parts of this post were co-written with Nicola Twilley).|>>","|>>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pmC-7-sNy74/U_YVrajKNMI/AAAAAAAAYMo/ruAVAz9Ecn8/s1600/image.adapt.960.high.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'art': 1})|>>"
"|>>The Great Age of Clouds|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-great-age-of-clouds.html|>>","|>>[Image: A ""hurricane"" at Saturn's south pole, via NASA; see also The Planetary Weather Report]. In Frédéric J. Pont's new book Alien Skies, he describes the atmospheres of other planets: what storms are like, what the clouds are made of, how a sunset might appear through a chemical haze at high pressure on another world. He points out, for example, that many of these ""alien skies"" would likely consist of wildly unfamiliar shapes and formations, as different elements would be capable of condensing to form clouds at ever-increasing heights. As he puts it, ""The type of compound likely to condense into clouds depends on the temperature, and varies from planet to planet. Earth has water clouds. Carbon dioxide clouds sometimes grace the Martian sky, and Venus is shrouded in sulphuric acid clouds. On the giant planets, successive cloud decks are made of different compounds as the temperature increases in the deeper layers.""  [Image: J.M.W. Turner, ""Storm at Sea"" (1824), courtesy of Tate Britain]. However, I should emphasize that all of this stuff needs to be put into the context of the Hudson River School and European Romanticism, of so-called ""representational exploration art"" of earlier scientific expeditions, where humans attempted to visually depict the wild worlds they'd plunged themselves into.  You shouldn't see this stuff and think of astronomy, in other words. You should think of J.M.W. Turner or John Constable, of huge coastal storms and mountain passes lit by lightning, of ships dashed on the rocks as wrathful pillars of dark cloud spiral into the blackness of space above terrified figures for whom weather bears traces of omnipotence.  Only now the weather is even more spectacular, and it is glimpsed on planets more exotic than any continent to which artists have traveled before. The weather on other planets should not be left only to scientists, in other words, but needs always to be considered in the context of art and landscape history.  [Image: John Constable, ""Seascape Study with Rain Cloud"" (c. 1824), via Wikipedia]. In any case, Pont explains that, as you move higher into some of the otherworldly atmospheres he describes, you would continually pass into entirely new elements—carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia—now frozen or condensed, billowing and moving about in the wind, capable of assuming structures unlike anything seen on Earth, vast ""waves, spirals and tentacles,"" or ""unpredictable storm patterns"" and even giant hexagons, as weird configurations unlock through a chemical sky. [Image: The great hexagon at Saturn's north pole, via Universe Today]. The book is less landscape poetry, however—sadly, after all, as what an incredible book of poems it would be, simply describing the skies of other worlds—than a scientific introduction to atmospheric chemistry, including here on Earth. But don't hold that against it. For instance, during Pont's survey of the atmosphere of the early Earth, he makes an interesting and particularly evocative observation, one worth repeating here.  As he points out, the early Earth—for a period that lasted nearly a billion years—was quite boring, geologically speaking, ""because nothing much happened to the rocks in a billion years."" But the skies were another matter.  [Image: A false-color image of the ""hurricane"" at Saturn's south pole, via NASA; the eye is estimated to be 1,250 miles wide]. ""The oxygen content in the atmosphere was stable,"" Pont explains, ""at around 0.1 percent. This was not enough to produce an ozone layer. Therefore the stratospheric lid that kept the clouds below ten miles in the present Earth did not operate.""  This had at least one spectacular side-effect: Convection must have extended much higher into the atmosphere. This would have been called ""the Great Age of Clouds"" by any visitor, since the high temperatures, large oceans and lack of stratospheric lid would have produced the most magnificent cloud formations and the most awesome storms.Imagine standing on the shore of some rocky archipelago billions of years before any other humans were born, as massive and otherworldly storms four or five times taller than anything you'd ever seen come rolling over the horizon, torqued into strange tropical towers, flashing in every crevice with lightning to reveal vast humid interiors where air roars upward in near-permanent mushroom clouds, breaking open to reveal shells of orange and red storms within storms boiling continuously for weeks at a time. The Great Age of Clouds would be in full performance.

"|>>The Fall|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-fall.html|>>","|>>[Image: David Maisel, from ToledoContemporánea]. At the end of 2013, photographer David Maisel was commissioned to photograph the city of Toledo, Spain, as part of a group exhibition called ToledoContemporánea, timed for a wider celebration of the 400th birthday of the painter El Greco. Maisel's photos offered a kind of aerial portraiture of the city, including its labyrinthine knots of rooftops. But the core of the project consists of disorientingly off-kilter, almost axonometric shots of the city's historic architecture. [Image: David Maisel, from ToledoContemporánea]. On wider flights beyond the edge of the city, modern swirls of highways are seen coiling through the landscape, like snakes preparing for arrival; in a sense, their geometry mimics—or perhaps mocks—the bewildering whorls of tiny streets and passages seen in the city's core.  [Image: David Maisel, from ToledoContemporánea]. While he was in the country, however, Maisel took advantage of some extra time and access to a helicopter to explore the landscape between Toledo and Madrid, a short stretch of infrastructural connections, agricultural hinterlands, abandoned suburban developments, and arid hills. The result was a new series of photos called The Fall.  [Image: David Maisel, from The Fall]. As Maisel writes, The Fall suggests a genre in which ""the worlds of painting and photography have merged together,"" creating an ironically abstract form of landscape documentation.  This is most evident in the photos from an area called Vicalvaro on the outskirts of Madrid. As Maisel explains, this is ""where construction was halted after the economic collapse of 2008. The abandoned zones appear like the surreal aftermath of a bombed out city or an alien landing field."" [Images: David Maisel, from The Fall]. But, as seen in Maisel's photos, they could also just as easily be extreme close-ups of minimalist oil paintings, nearly microscopic zooms into the texture of another method of representation to reveal a different kind of landscape there, one created by pigments and dyes. [Image: David Maisel, from The Fall]. This is an interrupted landscape, a geography elaborately and expensively prepared for something that has yet to arrive.  However, the dead abstractions of Vicalvaro were only one part of the ""three different areas of the Spanish landscape"" that Maisel says he set out to see. [Image: David Maisel, from The Fall]. Another landscape type—true to form, considering Maisel's pre-existing focus on landscapes of industrial use—are borax extraction sites.  These are ""strange, ashen landscapes,"" he writes, seen ""in a mining and agricultural region of La Mancha. The soil is laden with the mineral borax, which gives a surreal, ashen quality; the landscape shines, almost like a grey sea in a desert.""  They're like windowpanes—or mercury lakes—reflecting the afternoon light. [Image: David Maisel, from The Fall]. The surface of the earth becomes weirdly metallic in these shots, just a thin surface scraped away to reveal something seemingly utterly unnatural beneath, as if some divine force has begun etching the earth, scratching and engraving incomprehensible shapes into the planet. [Images: David Maisel, from The Fall]. In many cases, amidst these grooved and metallized landscapes, gridded blooms of plant life have been introduced both to visually interrupt and physically contain the landscape.  Among other things, their roots help to secure disturbed dirt and soil from blowing away in heavy winds—but they also act to recuperate the terrain aesthetically, as if seeing these robotic fields the color of gunmetal was so philosophically unsettling for local residents that plants had to be brought in to make things seem earthly once again.  What we're seeing is thus not really arboriculture, but a kind of existential stagecraft, a rigorously constructed landscape whose ironic purpose is to shield us from the true artificiality of our surroundings. [Images: David Maisel, from The Fall]. In fact, these bring us around nicely to the third landscape type Maisel says he was exploring with these photographs, joining the abandoned developments and borax sites that we've already seen, above. This is Fuensalida, or a region of ""croplands in the La Mancha region"" that have been ""gridded, crosshatched, and abstracted."" [Images: David Maisel, from The Fall]. Like the exquisite tree farms documented by Dutch photographer Gerco de Ruijter, these rob viewers of any real sense of scale. What are, in fact, trees appear instead to be small tufts of fabric pushing up through a needlepointing mesh. It could be a carpet interrupted mid-weave, or it could be some worn patch of clothing rubbed raw to reveal the underlying pattern for all to see. [Images: David Maisel, from The Fall]. But it's just landscape: the earth reformatted again, made artifactual and strange, carefully touched up for human culture. This is just a selection of images, however; click through to Maisel's website to see the full series. (All images by David Maisel, used with permission.

"|>>Survey Says|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/survey-says.html|>>","|>>[Image: Screen-grab from The New York Times]. Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo Butters ""has created a drone air force to map, monitor and safeguard his country’s ancient treasures,"" according to the New York Times.  Researchers in Peru ""struggle to protect the country’s archaeological heritage from squatters and land traffickers, who often secure property through fraud or political connections to profit from rising land values,"" we read. ""Experts say hundreds, perhaps thousands of ancient sites are endangered by such encroachment.""  What's needed, it seems, is a kind of standing army or reserve corps of mechanical eyes, ready to take flight at a moment's notice and document abuses or vandalism at historic sites, and this, the article implies, is at least one of the ultimate goals. Indeed, ""drones can address the problem, quickly and cheaply, by providing bird’s-eye views of ruins that can be converted into 3-D images and highly detailed maps.""  At least that's the goal. Actually watching the ""drone air force"" at work, however, doesn't quite live up to rhetorical expectations. Instead, sand grains cause mechanical failure, batteries need to be checked and replaced, the geometrically skewed images coming back from the camera are difficult to reconcile with one another, and the small team of archaeological operators only manages to perform a short flight over the targeted valley before calling their DJI Phantom back to base. Having said that, though, aerial landscape data culled not just from UAVs but from cameras and scanning equipment carried by kites, helium balloons, satellites, light aircraft, and even helicopter patrols has had a transformative effect on archaeological fieldwork.  [Image: A glimpse of the balloon rig, from Mozas-Calvache et al., Journal of Archaeological Science]. Just one example of this—and there are literally hundreds, as any search through publications such as the Journal of Archaeological Science or World Archaeology will reveal—was an exploration of how the images produced by balloon-based ""light aerial platforms"" could be made more useful.  Of course, the possible uses for this technique in contemporary architectural or urban documentation and analysis should not be overlooked. [Image: The balloon rig diagrammed, from Mozas-Calvache et al., Journal of Archaeological Science]. As authors A.T. Mozas-Calvache et al., from the University of Jaen in Spain, explain in a paper for the Journal of Archaeological Science, they have developed ""a complete methodology for performing photogrammetric surveying of archaeological sites using light aerial platforms or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Traditionally, the main problem with using these platforms is the irregular geometry of the photographs obtained.""  This can make combining the resulting images into a comprehensible map or visual survey fantastically time-consuming, if not sometimes impossible; by comparison, think of a badly stitched panorama on your smartphone, now multiple that times a hundred and you can imagine some of the difficulty involved.  Instead, Mozas-Calvache and Co. built a helium-balloon-based ""light aerial platform"" whose ""spatial coordinates are incorporated in the memory card of a robotized total station for automatic tracking of a 360 º mini reflector prism installed in the camera platform""—all of which is just a more precise way of saying that the location of the camera or scanner is precisely known at every step of its passage over the site, and the resulting, well-gridded images can thus be more easily reconciled.  [Image: Some resulting images, from Mozas-Calvache et al., Journal of Archaeological Science]. But now we're getting off-topic.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Marcin Platek]. Norwegian caves are being stuffed full of U.S. military equipment, including armored Humvees, tanks, and cargo containers full of weaponry, all part of a vast and semi-subterranean supply chain maintained to help wage future wars around the world.  The Marines have ""stashed weapons and equipment in the Norwegian countryside since the 1980s,"" War is Boring explains, in sites that include artificially enlarged and fortified caves. It's all about logistics: ""With this setup, Marines can fly in and be ready for a fight in no time."" [Image: ""Rows of front loaders and 7-ton trucks sit, gassed up and ready to roll in one of the many corridors in the Frigard supply cave located on the Vaernes Garrison near Trondheim, Norway.

All the caves total more than 900,000 sq. ft. of storage space, full of enough gear to outfit 13,000 Marines for up to 30 days."" U.S. Marine Corps photo by Sgt. Matt Lyman]. These facilities are commonly described as ""supply caves,"" and they hold warfighting gear in a state of indefinite readiness, ""reserved for any time of crisis or war."" Marines can simply fly in, unlock their respective caves, and grab the keys to one of hundreds, if not thousands, of combat-ready vehicles, all ""gassed up and ready to roll in one of the many corridors"" of this subterranean empire on the edges of American influence. Among many other points of interest, the Marines identify six such supply caves in the caption of one image and seven caves in the caption of another, as if—assuming this is not just a minor clerical error—the Marines themselves don't even know how many caves they have.  Instead, there's just Norway, some faraway land of underground voids we've stuffed full of combat gear, like emperors stocking our own tombs in advance of some future demise—the actual number of caves be damned, for who will be left counting at the end of the world? [Image: ""Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles and trailers, which belong to Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway are staged in a storage cave at Tromsdal, Norway, Feb. 24, 2014.

U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Sullivan Laramie]. On one level, I'm reminded of Marcus Trimble's old joke that France has been constructing a back-up version of itself in China. It is a frenzied act of ""pre-emptive preservation,"" led by the cultural ministers of that sclerotic nation of well-tended chateaux who realized that la belle France could only survive if they built immediately ready copies of themselves elsewhere. Only, in France's case, it wasn't willful self-burial in Norwegian caves, but in the real estate free-for-all of urban China. After all, Trimble suggested, that country's ""construction industry seems perfect for the task of backing up bricks rather than bits—cheap and powered by the brute force of sheer population. Copies of places may be made in a fraction of the time that it took to create them. If, in the event of a catastrophic episode, the part of France in question could be restored and life would go on as it was before."" [Image: ""China: ample space for a spare copy of France""; image by Marcus Trimble]. Militarize this, secret it away in a cave in Scandinavia, and you have something roughly approximately what's called the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program.  However, I was also reminded of a recent paper by Pierre Belanger and Alexander Scott Arroyo at Harvard's GSD. There, Belanger and Arroyo describe the U.S. military as a kind of planetary logistics challenge. (A PDF of their paper is available here courtesy of the U.S. Department of Defense). Specifically, it is the problem of building and often violently maintaining ""logistics islands,"" as Belanger and Arroyo describe them, that now characterizes much of the U.S. military's global behavior, an endless quest for finding and protecting ""a secure staging ground adjacent to the theater of operations,"" in an era when adjacency is increasingly hard to define. As they explain:  While logistical acquisitions are managed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), logistical operations in the field are predominantly coordinated by USTRANSCOM. On average, the command oversees almost 2,000 air missions and 10,000 ground shipments per week, with 25 container ships providing active logistical support. From October 2009 through September 2010 alone, USTRANSCOM flew 37,304 airlift missions carrying over 2 million passengers and 852,141 tons of cargo; aerially refueled 13,504 aircraft with 338,856,200 pounds of fuel on 11,859 distinct sorties; and moved nearly 25 million tons of cargo in coordinated sea-land operations. DLA and USTRANSCOM and their civilian partners are responsible for the largest, most widespread, and most diverse sustained logistics operation in history.The largest, most widespread, and most diverse sustained logistics operation in history. The obvious and intended resonance here is that military operations perhaps now most closely resemble complicated UPS deliveries than anything like actual ground combat. However, we can also infer from this that establishing new and ever more convenient logistics islands is vital to U.S. national security. A literal archipelago of shipping hubs is thus key to the country's global military activities, and this not only requires sites like Diego Garcia, which Belanger and Arroyo specifically write about, or even the ""mobile offshore bases"" they also describe, where the pop-up urbanism of Archigram has been inadvertently realized by the U.S. military, but artificially fortified caves near the Arctic Circle where truly daunting amounts of military materiel are now kept on hand, as if held frozen in some imperial freezer, awaiting the day when global tensions truly heat up.

"|>>The Future T.B.D.|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-future-tbd.html|>>","|>>[Image: The TBD Catalog from the Near Future Laboratory]. The TBD Catalog soon to be published by the Near Future Laboratory is a fictional catalog of possible products, all described and illustrated like mail-order props in some unrealized everyday life of tomorrow. Part satire, part industrial brainstorm, it's a mix of impractical ideas and thought-provoking future goods, whether that means the absurd weather-sensing hair extensions or (entirely plausible) DIY home-bioluminescence kits.  [Image: The TBD Catalog from the Near Future Laboratory]. The New Future Lab's goal was to ""take the things that seemed liminal, the things in the laboratories, in the public media, in science-fiction films, in economic projections and then extrapolate these ideas and prototypes and make them into 'things' in the near future."" They sought ""to design-develop prototypes and shape embryonic concepts in order to discard them, make them better, reconsider what we may take for granted."" To come up with tomorrow's products today.  It is the catalog as speculative literature, or the inventor's notebook as a mode of critical inquiry. Call it counter-production: something that creatively mocks and toys with the idea that we can only experience futurity through the cyclical release and ritual consumption of new commodities. [Image: The TBD Catalog from the Near Future Laboratory]. The resulting objects, services, home goods, and even new forms of food are not just ""hyperbolic perfections,"" as the authors write, or sleek and empty new corporate products, but ""things as they would exist as part of normal, ordinary, everyday life. If you stopped today and [were] transported to the near future, what would the world look like?""  What products would you buy? What services would you rely on? What would sit at home on your shelves? The group's hope was that, in answering these questions, they might discover—even if only in parody—the outline of the world to come and reveal many of the false assumptions built into a market-based vision of tomorrow. Along those lines, for example, they posit something called algoriture, or an emergent library of algorithmically-written literature, AI-generated on the fly. [Image: The TBD Catalog from the Near Future Laboratory]. These are like little machine folktales produced through some narrative averaging of other written works, priced by genre and archetype.  Each text is thus ""a guaranteed unique, custom book for you based on books you’ve read and enjoyed—and a matrix of genre specifications you provide. Each book is guaranteed unique and guaranteed enjoyable—or your money back. Only works of fiction. Genres: romance, technothriller, science-fiction, fantasy, thriller, young adult (incl. fairy tale), mystery and more."" [Image: The TBD Catalog from the Near Future Laboratory]. The actual catalog—which begins shipping on September 1, 2014—is ""not your near future of superlative Silicon Valley exuberance,"" they write, ""where you happily 3D-print a perfect set of lease-licensed Opinel steak knives or blissfully commute to work in your fascistically sleek Google-powered, chem-battery fueled autonomous vehicles. Nor is this the abysmal near future where you huddle in the smoldering foxholes of apocalyptic ruin. TBD Catalog runs through the middle. It is neither extreme. It is a design fiction about a normal, ordinary everyday near future.""  [Images: The TBD Catalog from the Near Future Laboratory]. In the end, the authors write, ""A report (or catalog, such as TBD) offers a way to normalize those extraordinary ideas and represent them as entirely ordinary. We imagined it to be a catalog of some sort, as might appear in a street vending box in any neighborhood, or in a pile next to the neighborhood real estate guides or advertising-based classified newspapers near the entrance to your local convenience store.""

"|>>Buy a Fort|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/buy-fort.html|>>","|>>[Image: Screengrab via the BBC]. A maritime fort constructed in the 1860s in the middle of the Thames Estuary is on the market for half a million pounds, or roughly $835,000.  [Image: Screengrab via the BBC]. With its fifteen-foot thick walls and insanely daunting approach—accessible on foot only at low tide and, even then, after a squelching walk across seemingly endless mudflats—it's certainly a good option if you're looking for solitude. Here it is on Google Maps. [Images: Screengrabs via the BBC]. At first glance, it's an amazing offshore castle, a fairy tale artificial island of 19th-century military Romanticism roughly an hour's boat ride east of London. [Images: Screengrabs via the BBC]. But don't jump in too quickly, lest you overlook the ruinous state of the place: it needs almost literally everything, from plumbing to electricity, glass windows to the most thorough cleaning you could imagine, having been open to the oceanic elements for decades. [Image: Screengrab via the BBC]. The BBC has a video of the place, complete with a muddy walk-through and shots at both low and high tide.  [Images: Screengrabs via the BBC]. All negatives aside, though, this looks awesome; convince your billionaire best friend to buy it and we'll turn it into an offshore architecture school with an elective minor in the design of fortified micronations, complete with a bizarre summer school featuring boat-borne reenactments of famous sea battles throughout history...

"|>>Right to Light|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/right-to-light.html|>>","|>>[Image: Random image of street lights]. Parts of Copenhagen are being turned into an outdoor night-lighting experiment, aiming to determine exactly how—even to what extent—cities should be illuminated at night, not only to use resources most efficiently but to increase urban security.  A mix of context-sensitive and remotely controlled lighting systems will be deployed, and each light will have its own IP address for outside monitoring. ""Sensors that track traffic density, air quality, noise, weather conditions and UV radiation will also be fitted throughout the site to see what sort of environment the lights are operating in,"" New Scientist explains. ""All this will help work out which lights are making the biggest difference in terms of lowering costs and emissions.""  The visual results will be not unlike an outdoor museum of experiential light art, a kind of an ""Urban Light"" sculpture blown up to the scale of a neighborhood, and the Danish Outdoor Lighting Lab—or DOLL as it's known—is even meant to be toured as such. While ""engineers will have freedom to toy with the different products,"" we also read that ""foreign officials who are curious about the technology can comparison-shop for their hometown."" [Image: Another random image of a street light]. But these networked and responsive urban lighting systems also come with political implications, including an effect on how the city can be monitored by authorities.  Indeed, ""Fitting street lamps with complex sensors—and hooking them up to a larger network that controls the city—will have implications far outside of lighting,"" the article explains. ""If a street lamp senses a sudden rush of people in an area that's usually deserted at night, police could be tipped off to go check the area out."" And, by extension, those streets could be dramatically flooded with blazing incandescence, transforming the city's infrastructure into a kind of giant police spotlight. It's not hard to imagine life in one of these smart-lit neighborhoods of the future where, one evening, a suspect—perhaps you—has been chased by police; whole streets light up strategically, one by one, tracking the suspect—guilty or not—as he or she attempts to flee, small emergency lights even turning on in spots where they had previously been invisible. Other streets and alleys dim to help hide police in the darkness. Infrastructure becomes not just civic but tactical.  Recall Evgeny Morozov's look at the smart city as a kind of urban police state. Writing for The Guardian earlier this summer, Morozov suggested that, ""As both cars and roads get 'smart,' they promise nearly perfect, real-time law enforcement. Instead of waiting for drivers to break the law, authorities can simply prevent the crime."" They can simply darken entire neighborhoods—or flood them with the brilliance of a thousand LED suns. [Image: One more random street light image]. Police-enabled pieces of urban infrastructure are, for Morozov, ""emblematic of transformations in many other domains, from smart environments for 'ambient assisted living' where carpets and walls detect that someone has fallen, to various masterplans for the smart city, where municipal services dispatch resources only to those areas that need them."" Thanks to sensors and internet connectivity, the most banal everyday objects have acquired tremendous power to regulate behavior. Even public toilets are ripe for sensor-based optimisation: the Safeguard Germ Alarm, a smart soap dispenser developed by Procter & Gamble and used in some public WCs in the Philippines, has sensors monitoring the doors of each stall. Once you leave the stall, the alarm starts ringing—and can only be stopped by a push of the soap-dispensing button. Perhaps the DOLL experiment reveals that we can now add street lights to that list: smart targeting systems that make decisions in real-time as to which residents and neighborhoods have a right to light and who shall be punished by the induced darkness of an infrastructure that no longer wants to turn on for them.|>>","|>>http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n1vBkM6PiKI/U-o2V1hlfuI/AAAAAAAAYCw/6zuqdUHRbPU/s1600/streetlamps.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'technology': 1})|>>"
"|>>Seismic Suburb|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/seismic-suburb.html|>>","|>>[Image: Screengrab from Stuff showing the test-suburb, a kind of seismic Operation Doorstep]. An empty suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, abandoned after the 2011 earthquake, was bombed from below last autumn, as a series of carefully timed underground explosions set off an artificial earthquake. The controlled seismic event was part of a closely studied experiment to test how soil liquefaction could be reduced or even eliminated by better geotechnical design.  As Next City explains, it was a 70-year old former resident of the neighborhood named Martin Howman who kicked off the event, triggering the buried necklace of explosives beneath his own street and the houses of his neighbors.  ""As he pressed the buttons,"" Charles Anderson writes for Next City, ""a piece of Howman’s old neighborhood, long since abandoned, jumped and jostled just like it had the day of the 2011 quake. Cameras inside the homes showed floor boards shaking and kitchen benches being thrown from their foundations. Drones hovering above captured images of roof tiles being shaken loose and shock waves thudding through the earth. Signs had been placed throughout the wider area to reassure passersby that the sounds were just science in action. Many gathered at a safe distance to watch the spectacle unfold."" In video footage of the event, small clouds of dust can be seen bucking upward from the roofs of houses to drift away in a light breeze as the soil continues to jolt and shudder.  Stuff reported at the time that Howman's initial response to the near-total abandonment of his neighborhood after the 2011 earthquake was that ""he might buy a tractor and some cows and revert the land back to dairy farm""—but, instead, he stuck around just long enough to see the empty streets transformed into a seismic research facility like something out the work of Lebbeus Woods. Recall, for example, the ideas behind Woods's film treatment, Underground Berlin. There—as we explored here on BLDGBLOG back in 2013—Woods posited a fictional network of government seismic labs secretly operating beneath the surface of Berlin, called the Underground Research Station.  [Image: From Underground Berlin by Lebbeus Woods]. Inside the Station, Woods's unmade film would have shown, ""many scientists and technicians are working on a project for the government to analyze and harness the tremendous, limitless geological forces active in the earth... a world of seismic wind and electromagnetic flux."" Their eventual goal is to achieve ""a mastery""—that is, to weaponize—the ""primordial earth forces"" they actively study. In his book OneFiveFour, Woods pushes these ideas further, describing a city so defined by the seismic energy destabilizing the ground beneath it that almost every building and surface has been covered in ""oscilloscopes, refractors, seismometers, interferometers, and other, as yet unknown instruments, measuring light, movement, force, change.""  The entire city has become a seismic instrument where ""tools for extending perceptivity to all scales of nature are built spontaneously, playfully, experimentally, continuously modified in home laboratories, in laboratories that are homes... Indeed, each object—chair, table, cloth, examining apparatus, structure—is an instrument; each material thing connects the inhabitants with events in the world around him and within himself.”  In a video posted on Stuff, the ground rhythmically ripples and pops from below, as if a living creature has stirred beneath the cracked foundations of this empty neighborhood, ""primordial earth forces"" intent on resisting the architecture so flimsily built upon their shoulders.

"|>>Cultivating the Map|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/cultivating-map.html|>>","|>>[Image: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills].  For his final thesis project at the endangered Cooper Union, Danny Wills explored how survey instruments, cartographic tools, and architecture might work together at different scales to transform tracts of land in the geographic center of the United States. [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. Called ""Cultivating the Map,"" his project is set in the gridded fields, sand hills, playas, and deep aquifers of the nation's midland, where agricultural activity has left a variety of influential marks on the region's landscapes and ecosystems.  [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. Its final presentation is light on text and heavy on models, maps, and diagrams, yet Wills still manages to communicate the complex spatial effects of very basic physical tools, how things as basic as survey grids and irrigation equipment can bring whole new regimes of territorial management into existence.  It's as if agriculture is actually a huge mathematical empire in the middle of the country—a rigorously artificial world of furrows, grids, and seasons—dedicated to reorganizing the surface of the planet by way of relatively simple handheld tools and then rigorously perfecting the other-worldly results. [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. Wills produced quite a lot of material for the project, including a cluster of table-sized landscapes that show these tools and instruments as they might be seen in the field. [Image: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. In many ways, parts of the project bring to mind the work of Smout Allen, who also conceive of architecture as just one intermediary spatial product on a scale that goes from the most intricate of handheld mechanisms to super-sized blocks of pure infrastructure. Imagine Augmented Landscapes transported to the Great Plains and animated by a subtext of hydrological surveying and experimental agriculture. Deep and invisible bodies of water exert slow-motion influence on the fields far above, and ""architecture"" is really just the medium through which these spatial effects can be cultivated, realized, and distributed.  This, it seems, is the underlying premise of Wills's project, that architecture is like a valve through which new landscapes pass. [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. In any case, I've included a whole bunch of images here, broadly organized by tool or, perhaps more accurately, by cartographic idea, where the system of projection suggested by Wills's devices have had some sort of spatial effect on the landscape in which they're situated. However, I've also been a little loose here, organizing these a bit by visual association, so it's entirely possible that my ordering of the images has thrown off the actual narrative of the project—in which case, it's probably best just to check out Wills's own website if you're interested in seeing more. [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. The project includes land ordinance survey tools and irrigation mechanisms, a ""Mississippi River levee tool"" and the building-sized ""grain elevator tool."" [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. In Danny's own words, the project ""finds itself in the territory of the map, proposing that the map is also a generative tool. Using the drawing as fertile ground, this thesis attempts a predictive organization of territory through the design of four new tools for the management of natural resources in the Great Plains, a region threatened with the cumulative adverse effects of industrial farming. Each tool proposes new ways of drawing the land and acts as an instrument that reveals the landscape’s new potential."" These ""new potentials"" are often presented as if in a little catalog of ideas, with sites named, located, and described, followed by a diagrammatic depiction of what Wills suggests might spatially occur there. [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. The ambitious project earned Wills both the Henry Adams AIA Medal & Certificate of Merit, and the school's Yarnell Thesis Prize in Architecture. [Images: ""Cultivating the Map"" by Danny Wills]. I'll wrap up here with a selection of images of the landscapes, tools, and instruments, but click over to Danny's site for a few more. Here are also some descriptions, where all text is italics is courtesy of Wills:  Tool 1: Meanders, Fog Fences, Air Wells   Tool 1 attaches itself to the groundwater streams, both proposing tools to redirect and slow down the flow, as well as tools to collect atmospheric water through technological systems like air wells and fog fences, forming new bodies and streams of water. The new air wells collect atmospheric water through a system of cooling and heating a substrate core inside of a ventilated exterior shell. The air wells also become spaces to observe the re-directing flow of water, as overflow quantities are appropriately managed.  Tool 2: Aquifer Irrigation Ponds Tool 2 uses the center pivot irrigation rigs to reconstruct the ground, making bowls in the landscape that act as dew ponds. At the same time, the wells become tools and markers to survey the levels of the aquifer below, signifying changes in the depth through elevational changes above. New forms of settlement begin to appear around each ring as a balance is reached between extraction and recharge of the aquifer.  Tool 3: Sand Dunes, Grazing Fields Tool 3 uses gas wells as new geo-positioning points, redrawing boundaries and introducing controlled grazing and fallowing zones into the region. Walls are also built as markers of the drilling wells below, creating a dune topography to retain more ground water. Each repurposed oil rig becomes an architectural element that both provides protection and feed for grazing animals as well as a core sample viewing station. The abandoned rigs suspend cross sections of the earth to educate visitors of the geological history of the ground they stand on.  Tool 4: Water Recycling Station Tool 4 converts the grain elevator into a water recycling station, filling the silos with different densities of sand and stone to filter collected types of water- rain, ground run-off, grey, brackish, etc. Large pavilion like structures are built between houses, collecting water and providing shade underneath. Some housing is converted into family-run markets; the new social space under the pavilions provide for market space. The repurposed grain elevator becomes the storage center for the region’s new water bank. Economic control is brought back to the local scale.

"|>>The Comet as Landscape Art|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-comet-as-landscape-art.html|>>","|>>[Image: Photo courtesy ESA]. Intrigued by these images as an example of how the tradition of landscape representation has rapidly progressed—from the Romantics and the Hudson River School to Rosetta—I felt compelled to post a few photos of the craggy and glacial surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, sent back to Earth yesterday from the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft. The surface of the comet ""is porous, with steep cliffs and house-sized boulders,"" making it earth-like yet deeply treacherous, an irregular terrain to photograph and a dangerous place to land.  [Image: Photo courtesy ESA]. It is the notion of ""land"" here that is most interesting, however, as this is really just the imposition of a terrestrial metaphor onto a deeply alien body. Yet the comet is, in effect, literally a glacier: a malleable yet permanently frozen body of ice hurtling through space, occasionally exploding in comas and tails of vapor.  It is ""an ancient landscape,"" we read, ""and yet one that looks strangely contemporary as the sun vaporizes ice, reworking the terrain like a child molding clay.""  Think Antarctica in a winter storm, not southern Utah—or Glacier National Park, not the Grand Canyon.  [Image: Photo courtesy ESA]. Along those lines, some of the most provocative writing on what it means to visually represent the frozen and hostile landscapes of the Antarctic is by writer William L. Fox, whose work offers some useful resonance here.  Fox has written, for example, about the technical and even neurological difficulties in accurately representing—let alone comprehending or simply navigating—Antarctic space and the vast forms that frame it.  Distant landscapes distorted by thermal discontinuities; white levels pushed to the absolute limit of film chemistry; impossible contours throwing off any attempt at depth perception; even the difficulty of distinguishing complicated mirages from actual landforms: these are all part of the challenge of creating images of an exotic landscape such as the Antarctic.  As Fox writes, it was even specifically the tradition of Dutch landscape painting, combined with the maritime practice of sketching coastal profiles, that first introduced the visual world of the Antarctic to western viewers: it was thus seen as an ominous, ice-clogged horizon of fog and low clouds looming always just slightly out of ship's reach at the bottom of the world.    He calls this the genre of ""representational exploration art."" [Image: Photo by Stuart Klipper from his fantastic book, The Antarctic: From the Circle to the Pole, with a foreword by William L. Fox]. In one interesting passage in his book Terra Antarctica, he suggests that the south polar landscape is so extreme, it often resists natural analogy. As Fox describes it, the wind-carved boulders and isolated pillars and cliffs of ice are more like ""artworks by Salvador Dalí and Henry Moore, evoking the spirit of surrealism with the former and modernist forms with the latter. The Antarctic is so extreme to our visual expectations that, once we attempt to move beyond measurement to describe it, analogies with other parts of nature fall short, and we resort to comparisons with cultural artifacts that push at the boundaries of our perceptions.""  These include ""cultural artifacts such as sculpture and architecture, products more of the imagination than of nature."" Consider, for instance, that comet 67P is widely known today as the ""rubber-duck comet"" due to its bifurcated structure, implying, as Fox suggests with the Antarctic, that no natural analogy seemed adequate for describing the comet's geometry. [Image: The gateway arches of the Antarctic; photo by Stuart Klipper from, The Antarctic: From the Circle to the Pole, foreword by William L. Fox]. But what are we to make of comet 67P now that we can see it as a physical landscape, not just an ephemeral optical phenomenon passing, at great distance, through the sky? When a blur becomes focused as terrain, what is the best way to describe it? What visual or textual traditions are the most useful or evocative—vedas and sutras or laboratory reports? Put another way, is poetry as appropriate as a scientific survey in such a circumstance—should ""we attempt to move beyond measurement to describe it,"" in Fox's words—and, if not, what new genres of exploration art might result from this spatial encounter?  I'm reminded here of poet Christian Bök's wry remark on Twitter: ""I am still amazed that poets insist on writing about their divorces, when robots are taking pictures of orange, ethane lakes on Titan...""  Now that humans are beginning to land semi-autonomous camera-ships on the frozen ice fields of passing comets, sending back the (off)world's strangest landscape art—as if a direct line runs from, say, the pastoral landscapes of Claude Lorrain or the elemental weirdness of J.M.W. Turner to the literally extraterrestrial boulders and gullies depicted by Rosetta—how should our own descriptive traditions adapt? What, we might ask, is comet 67P's role in art history?

"|>>Worshipping the Crash|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/worshipping-crash.html|>>","|>>[Image: Photo by BLDGBLOG]. There's a roadside shrine in Rajasthan where the remains of a crashed motorcycle have been transformed into a temple: a traffic accident from the 1980s now permanently frozen in time and architecturally framed as a site of pilgrimage for spiritually minded passers-by. I was traveling around the region a while back when our driver suddenly pulled over, saying he needed to see something. When we asked him what was happening, he simply said it was a shrine built from the remains of a crashed motorbike—and I was excited, because I had actually read about this place.  [Image: Photo by BLDGBLOG]. Any fan of J.G. Ballard would want to visit a site like this, due to its strange backstory and its even more amazing contemporary presentation: it's basically the motorcycle from a fatal road collision in the 1980s that's now been transformed into a literal shrine, a vernacular place of worship, meditation, and prayer.  The handlebars are draped with flowers, and believers walk ritual circuits around the motorbike all day, transforming it into a kind of supernatural fulcrum. A beautiful tree, wrapped in colorful threads and ornamented from its trunk to its branches with dyed strips of fabric, is the most immediately obvious marker along the cargo-heavy road that passes close by; as it happens, this tree played a central role in the events that would give this site its otherworldly significance. [Image: Photo by BLDGBLOG]. As the Lonely Planet Guide to Rajasthan described the place, it is ""one of the strangest temples in all India,"" a ""garland-decked Enfield Bullet motorcycle, known as Bullet Baba."" The story goes that local villager Om Bana died at this spot in the 1980s when his motorbike skidded into a tree. The bike was taken to the local police station, but then mysteriously twice made its own way back to the tree, and travelers along the road started seeing visions of Om Bana—inevitably leading to the machine's deification. Any time of day or night people can be seen at the open-air shrine here, praying for safe journeys and making offerings of liquor.We didn't stay long, unfortunately, but it felt like a scene from some black-market rewrite of Crash, rewritten for Indian readers in which holy accidents on various roads throughout the country are visited by over-enthusiastic tourists of the afterlife, intent on receiving ill-defined bursts of supernatural energy from celebrity collisions such as these. The U.S. might have its James Dean Crash Site & Memorial, and France might have the Pont de l'Alma Tunnel, but this machine-deification in the deserts of northern India showed what a rural folk tradition could do with the morbid significance of fatal crash sites and the often deeply unglamorous vehicles that enable them.|>>","|>>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DETP1VZ-rBU/U-LD4VOCMkI/AAAAAAAAX7c/y3OzOUpQO7w/s1600/MotorcycleShrine2.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"
"|>>The Spacecraft Cemetery|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-spacecraft-cemetery.html|>>","|>>[Image: The International Space Station, speculatively militarized]. While emailing with a colleague yesterday, I realized that I had never really written about the so-called ""spacecraft cemetery"" of the South Pacific, a remote patch of ocean water used as a kind of burial plot for derelict satellites.  As RT.com explains, the ""spacecraft cemetery"" is ""an area of the South Pacific, approximately 3,900 km from the capital of New Zealand, Wellington.  It is used to deposit the remains of spacecraft that do not burn up on re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, such as the carcass of the Russian Mir space station and waste-filled cargo ships. The remote location was specially selected for the disposal of spacecraft because of its depth of four km and distance from shipping lanes."" [Image: The South Pacific ""spacecraft cemetery""; image remade based on Wikipedia]. This vast crash site for abandoned Space Age artifacts might, in fact, become the final resting place of nothing less than the International Space Station. According to a slightly over-heated Russian press statement in 2011, the ISS could be deliberately crashed into the ocean as early as 2020.  As a spokesperson for Roscosmos said at the time, ""After it completes its existence, we will be forced to sink the [International Space Station]. It cannot be left in orbit; it's too complex, too heavy an object, it can leave behind lots of rubbish.""  Disastrously underfunded and devoid of human inhabitants by that point, this Mary Celeste of the near-earth orbit would meet a weird and watery fate, falling into the sea perhaps to seed some future artificial reef in the middle of nowhere. [Image: The International Space Station, courtesy NASA]. While the actual physical effects of this—assuming it even happens—would be little more than to create several miles of scattered metal and occasionally floating fragments of this once-spaceborne super-structure, the very idea that there is an international spacecraft cemetery in the middle of the South Pacific is incredible.  Of course, the reality of this is underwhelming—there is no well-preserved graveyard of physically intact Space Age objects out in the middle of the ocean—but the imaginative potential of a place like this is almost unbelievable, as if all these ruins from the sky might someday become a UNESCO World Heritage Site: an underwater museum of global space ruins perhaps even sign-posted like the Baltic shipwrecks we looked at the other week.  Wreck-diving the fallen airlocks of the International Space Station! A new Tintern Abbey of the sea as giant squid swim by in the distance and submarine lights flash eerily through clouds of silt. Rather than visit Cape Canaveral or Baikonur, you could instead slip, Captain Nemo-like, through the tides and currents of the remote ocean, peering ahead through thick glass as fantastic megastructures—rockets and satellites, offworld bases and labs—loom amidst the rock arches and mudflats of the planet's strangest museum, this benthic necropolis of dead spacecraft, haunted by silent and uncomprehending marine creatures in the darkness.

"|>>NATO's Underground Roman Super-Quarry|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/natos-underground-roman-super-quarry.html|>>","|>>[Image: An entrance to the quarry in Kanne; photo by Nick Catford via Subterranean Britannica]. There is an underground Roman-era quarry in The Netherlands that, when you exit, you will find that you have crossed an invisible international border somewhere down there in the darkness, and that you are now stepping out into Belgium; or perhaps it's the other way around, that there is an underground Roman-era quarry in Belgium that, when you exit, you will find that you have crossed an invisible international border somewhere down there in the darkness, and that you are now stepping out into The Netherlands.  However, this is not just a disused quarry—not just an archaeological site on the fringes of the Roman empire that was once mined for blocks of limestone. Its afterlife is by far the most interesting part of the story. For nearly a century, beginning in the 1800s, these underground hollows were used by Jesuit monks as a secluded place for prayer, study, and meditation, and even for the carving of elaborate and impressive forms into the soft rock walls; then the Nazis took over, transforming this weird underworld into a subterranean factory for World War II airplane parts; then, finally, pushing the stakes yet higher, the whole complex of former Roman limestone mines, straddling an international border underground between two modern European nations, was turned into a doomsday bunker for NATO, a dark and mold-prone labyrinth within which military commanders constructed a Joint Operations Center for responding to the end of the world (whenever the time finally came).  [Images: Monks underground; via De Limburgse Mergelgrotten]. ""There was even a 3-hole golf course complete with artificial turf,"" Subterranean Britannica reports in a recent issue of their excellent magazine, Subterranea. ""The complex was on average 50 meters below ground covering an area of approximately 6750 acres with eight miles of corridors, 400 branches and 399 individual offices,"" SubBrit explains. There were escape tunnels, as well, ""one going out to the banks of the Albert Canal in Belgium, and one which came out in a farmer's potato store in the village of Kanne."" It had its own water supply and even a dedicated wine cellar for NATO officers, who might need a glass of Europe's finest chardonnay to help feel calm enough to launch those missiles. Just look at this thing's mind-boggling floor plan.   The ""streets"" were named, but not always easy to follow; however, this didn't stop officers stationed there from occasionally going out to explore the older tunnels at night. A former employee named Bob Hankinson describes how he used to navigate: Most corners were roughly 90 degrees, but only roughly. Going through the caves was an exercise in left and right turns every 50 feet or so. Navigation was helped by street names. Unlike in the USA, where streets are numbered on a sort of grid pattern, these were zigzag streets. My office on Main Street and J Street, so if I got lost I would just keep walking until I came to either Main or J, and join it. If I went the wrong way, eventually the street would peter out either at the perimeter or a T-junction, and you would just turn round and go back the other way.As another former employee—a man named Alan Francis—explains, ""If I did have spare time, I would wander through the dark tunnels where there were very few lights on at night, thinking how strange it was to be working in a Roman stone quarry.""  Writing in Subterranea, SubBrit explains that ""nothing ever came out."" This was ""a strict rule: apart from people, anything that went in never came out. All waste material ranging from redundant furniture to foot waste was dumped in one of the sixteen underground landfill sites"" designated within this sprawling whorl of rooms and passages. Shredded documents were even mixed with water and applied directly to the walls as a kind of fibrous paste, used for insulation. Such was the secrecy surrounding this place that it was officially classified as ""a 'forbidden place' under the Protection of State Secrets Act which forbade people to even talk about it.""  One reason why the underground galleries are so vast, meanwhile, is apparently because of the character of the limestone they were carved through; in fact, ""the limestone was so soft that the workers used a chainsaw to cut it.""  The notion that I could just cut myself a whole new room with a chainsaw—just revving this thing up and carving an entire new hallway or corridor, pushing relentlessly forward into what looks like solid earth, possibly even sawing my way into the roots of another country—is so awesome an architectural condition that I would move there tomorrow if I could.  Just imagine building this titanic doorway into the earth with a small group of friends, a case of beer, and a few chainsaws. It's like Cappadocia by way of the Cold War. By way of Husqvarna. [Image: An entrance into the NATO complex; via this thread]. Sadly, the whole place is contaminated with asbestos and has been badly saturated with diesel fuel. At least one environmental analysis of the underground maze found that ""diesel fuel from the [copious emergency fuel] tanks had leaked into the porous limestone over a long period and had penetrated to a depth of about forty feet into the rock.""  You can imagine the weird bonfires that could have resulted should someone have been stupid enough to light a match, but ""this area had to be removed and disposed of,"" we read—presumably by chainsaw. Nonetheless, today you can actually take a tour of this place—this now-derelict doomsday logistics hub that straddles international borders underground—courtesy of the Limburg Landscape Foundation. If you can take the tour, let me know how it goes; I'd love to visit this place in person someday and would be thrilled to see any photographs.

The results of that trip are now out in this weekend's New York Times Magazine, called ""The Price of Cold,"" and she's put together an accompanying travelogue on Edible Geography that takes you to ""Ten Landmarks of the Chinese Cryosphere."" These new spatial monuments to the control of thermal energy include the dreamlike ""Room of the Sleeping Fish"" in Jinan, which sounds like something out of an early Rupert Thomson novel, where live fish are effectively refrigerated into a state of hibernation during which they can survive outside of water; the delightful, Willy Wonka-like ""Yogurt Control Room"" in Tianjin, where vats of active bacteria grow and proliferate under laboratory supervision; the more or less self-explanatory Beijing Vegetable Research Center; and a variety of wet markets, shops, and restaurants where you, too, can experience the electrically-powered, human-induced winter that is slowly spreading its tentacles across the nation.|>>","|>>none|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

"|>>Beneath the Forest, Buildings|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/beneath-forest-buildings.html|>>","|>>[Image: Photo by Heiko Prumers, courtesy of LiveScience].   The remains of artificial structures that pre-date the Amazon rainforest have been found beneath the trees in Bolivia and Brazil. The forest actually grew up and around their ruins, we read, gradually consuming these structures altogether as the rainforest we see there today slowly spread over hundreds of years and conquered the landscape. ""A series of square, straight and ringlike ditches scattered throughout the Bolivian and Brazilian Amazon were there before the rainforest existed,"" LiveScience reported earlier this month. Based on the research of a postdoctoral graduate student named John Francis Carson, the report suggests that ""the diggers of these ditches created them before the forest moved in around them. They continued to live in the area as it became forested, probably keeping clear regions around their structures."" [Image: Photo by Heiko Prumers, courtesy of LiveScience].   One of the most intriguing suggestions of the study is that the rainforest we see there today is actually, at its origins, what Carson calls ""a coproduction between humans and nature."" ""It's very likely, in fact,"" he explains, ""that people had some kind of effect on the composition of the forest... People might favor edible species, growing in orchards and things like that, [or] altered the soils, changing the soil chemistry and composition, which can have a longer-lasting legacy effect.""  In other words, the deliberate, long-term selection and cultivation of plant species preferred by humans would have led to a distinct type of forest growing in the region, not just a ""wild"" expanse of whatever plants could naturally survive.  The ancient forest was pruned, tended, and gardened, Carson's research suggests, and therefore has a kind of unnatural origin, not unlike an abandoned garden gone to seed.  [Image: Photo by Heiko Prumers, courtesy of LiveScience].   In fact, this brings to mind the fascinating work of UC Berkeley anthropologist Christine Hastorff, who has pointed out that many of the heavily vegetated Central American landscapes we inaccurately and over-simplistically describe as ""rainforest"" are actually ""feral gardens"": plots of artificially cultivated plants, vines, and trees, similar to orchards, that only later took on the appearance of wilderness after their gardeners were exterminated by Europeans. Hastorff—like Carson—suggests that traces of this human-induced artificiality at the scale of an entire ecosystem can still be detected in the landscape, following detailed investigations into what combinations of plants grow in what areas, and then comparing these to what we would expect to see growing without human interference. These landscapes are not really wild forests at all, then, Hastorff explains, but ""Maya village community garden plants that have gone feral. That isn’t the forest that was there before humans landed in the Americas."" In any case, Carson's work on the ""mysterious earthen rings"" found beneath the tree cover of the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon is certainly fascinating for its glimpse of human settlement patterns—that is, architecture—hidden beneath an incredible landscape. However, its even more intriguing take away is that this very landscape was—at least in part—cultivated and influenced by the people who built the ""earthen rings"" we see in these photographs. Developing the implications of this ""has only just started,"" he tells LiveScience.|>>","|>>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1lga9l899NA/U9G6eA5etPI/AAAAAAAAXtE/-pa55ScXU2g/s1600/ring-ditch-amazon-2.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"
"|>>Bunker Simulations|>>","|>>http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/bunker-simulations.html|>>","|>>[Image: A replica of the Nazis' Atlantic Wall defenses in Scotland; photo via Stirling 2014]. The continent-spanning line of concrete bunkers built by the Nazis during WWII, known as the ""Atlantic Wall,"" was partially recreated in the United Kingdom—in more than one location—to assist with military training.  These simulated Nazi bunkers now survive as largely overlooked ruins amidst the fields, disquieting yet picturesque earth forms covered in plants and lichen, their internal rebar exposed to the weather and twisted by explosives, serving as quiet reminders of the European battlefield.  The various wall sites even include trenches, anti-tank ditches, and other defensive works carved into the ground, forming a kind of landscape garden of simulated fortification. [Image: A replica of the Atlantic Wall in Scotland; photo via Stirling 2014]. As the Herald Scotland reported the other day, one of these walls ""was built at Sheriffmuir, in the hills above Dunblane, in 1943 as preparations were being made to invade Europe. The problem was the Nazis had built a formidable line of concrete defenses from Norway all the way to the Spanish border and if D-Day was to have any chance of success, the British and their allies would have to get over those defenses.""  This, of course, ""is why the wall at Sheriffmuir was built: it was a way for the British forces to practise their plan of attack and understand what they would face. They shot at it, they smashed into it, and they blew it up as a way of testing the German defences ahead of D-Day."" [Image: A replica of the Atlantic Wall in Scotland; photo via Stirling 2014]. It would certainly be difficult to guess what these structures are at first glance, or why such behemoth constructions would have been built in these locations; stumbling upon them with no knowledge of their history would suggest some dark alternative history of WWII in which the Nazis had managed to at least partially conquer Britain, leaving behind these half-buried fortresses in their wake. Indeed, the history of the walls remains relatively under-exposed, even in Britain, and a new archaeological effort to scan all of the defenses and mount an exhibition about them in the Dunblane Museum is thus now underway.  [Image: A replica of the Atlantic Wall in Scotland; photo via Stirling 2014]. The story of the Scottish wall's construction is also intriguingly odd. It revolves around an act of artistic espionage, courtesy of ""a French painter and decorator called Rene Duchez.""  Duchez, the newspaper explains, ""got his hands on the blueprints for the German defences while painting the offices of engineering group TODT, which [had been hired] to build the Atlantic walls. He hid the plans in a biscuit tin, which was smuggled to Britain and used as the blueprint for the wall at Sheriffmuir."" But Scotland is not the only UK site of a simulated Nazi super-wall: there were also ersatz bunkers built in Surrey, Wales, and Suffolk. In fact, the one in Surrey, built on Hankley Common, is not all that far from my in-laws, so I'll try to check it out in person next time I'm over in England.  [Images: An Atlantic Wall replica in Surrey; top photo by Shazz, bottom three photos via Wikipedia]. Attempts at archaeological preservation aside, these walls seem destined to fade into the landscape for the next several millennia, absorbed back into the forests and fields; along the way, they'll join other ancient features like Hadrian's Wall on the itinerary of future military history buffs, just another site to visit on a slow Sunday stroll, their original context all but forgotten.

When drinking warm cider in a park starts to get boring it’s good to know that autumn is there waiting like a trusty friend in a really great jumper just around the corner. Did you know that the season is as treacherous as it is beautiful? More people step in dog poo in autumn than in any other months. Fact. It lurks beneath kickable piles of leaves. On the plus side it is well-known for its magic feeling of refreshment – a certain back-to-school vibe that makes new projects and friendships seem exciting and energised.

The content, contributors, typeface and colour scheme were all decided by Albert – great news as he’s one of our favourites – but the actual concept and design of Cook Book were the responsibility of a studio we hadn’t yet heard of.

I’m loth to comment on summer’s swift disappearance or the vague possibility that it might get warm again in the coming weeks, but how can I miss the opportunity which this series by Anaïs Boileau has so generously handed me? This brilliant photo-series examines the women who live for a tan, happily sunning themselves with foil trays pressed to their chins and eye-protectors plastered to their sockets. There’s something gently teasing and kind of funny but also really well-constructed about her images – the props make for a natural frame so you’re confronted with a very immediate manifestation of our society’s obsession with bronzed skin, which seems more ridiculous the longer you think about it.

The thriving independent publishing sector is a constant fillip in the well-worn discussion over the future of print, but one new title is more direct than most in articulating its belief in a bright future for tangible reading material. Over recent months we watched with interest as Marcroy Smith of People of Print, announced, crowd-funded and launched Print Isn’t Dead and the response has been extremely positive. Conceived as “a showcase of outstanding illustration and design work demonstrating and pushing the boundaries of print in all forms” the Kickstarter campaign pulled in nearly £7,000 from an initial target of £4,520. This is, as you’d expect, a print lover’s dream, taking unashamedly “geekish delight in printing equipment” as MagCulture’s Jeremy Leslie put it.

They’re also the UK’s number one film channel, screening films for free since 2010. But we’ve always just liked them for their weird TV spots. When they launched their free service four years ago they had Lucy Liu, Ewan McGregor, Gael Garcia Bernal and Judi Dench dressed up in all manner of strange outfits making fools of themselves. Now they’ve grown up a bit and have a new look to show off, but the ads are no less enjoyable.

When that redesign is an online space it becomes so much more intriguing than a print publication doing the same thing; the web is like a constantly surging ocean and to move with the tide can be treacherous.

Visits [v.isits.in] automatically visualizes personal location histories, trips and travels by aggregating geotagged one's Flickr collection with a Google Maps history. developed by Alice Thudt, Dominkus Baur and prof. Sheelagh Carpendale, the map runs locally in the browser, so no sensitive data is uploaded to external servers.
The timeline visualization goes beyond the classical pin representation, which tend to overlap and are relatively hard to read. Instead, the data is shown as 'map-timelines', a combination of maps with a timeline that convey location histories as sequences of maps: the bigger the map, the longer the stay. This way, the temporal sequence is clear, as the trip starts with the map on the left and continues towards the right. 
A place slider allows the adjusting of the map granularity, reaching from street-level to country-level.

Culturegraphy [culturegraphy.com], developed by ""Information Model Maker"" Kim Albrecht reveals represent complex relationships of over 100 years of movie references.  
Movies are shown as unique nodes, while their influences are depicted as directed edges. The color gradients from blue to red that originate in the1980s denote the era of postmodern cinema, the era in which movies tend to adapt and combine references from other movies.
Although the visualizations look rather minimalistic at first sight, their interactive features are quite sophisticated and the resulting insights are naturally interesting. Therefore, do not miss out the explanatory movie below.

A World of Terror [periscopic.com] by Periscopic shows the reach, frequency and impact of about 25 terrorism groups around the world.
The visualization exists of 25 smartly organized pixel plots that are displayed as ordered small multiples. Ranging from Al-Qa'ida and the Taliban to less known organizations like Boko Haram, the plots reveal which ones are more deadly, are more recently active, or have been historically more active. In addition, all data can be filtered over time. 
The data is based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), the most comprehensive and open-source collection of terrorism data available.

Metrico [metrico-game.com], designed by  Dutch game design studio Digital Dreams, is a recently released video game for the Playstation Vita.  
Described as an ""atmospheric puzzle action game with a mindset of its own"", it's visual style has been completely based on the world of infographics. In essence, the concept of infographics seem to work as a gameplay environment not just because of its pretty aesthetics, but also because of its natural interaction with (visual) data. 
Consequently, in Metrico, each action is quantified and explicitly shown, such as the number of times an avatar needs to jump up and down or shoots a projectile. Metrico's goal is thus similar to most infographics: enticing users to make sense of a complex system.

Since we already know in what angle people put their face when taking a selfie in different cities, we now also know how they sleep differently: Which Cities Get the Most Sleep? [wsj.com] by interactive graphics editor Stuart A. Thompson of the Wall Street Journal compares the sleeping habits of citizens of different cities. 
On the topic of sleep, Jawbone also just released an interesting graph revealing how the recent Napa earthquake affected the sleep of local residents [jawbone.com]. Indeed, the distance to the epicenter seems to correlate to the number of people who awoke, and the time it took for them to get back to sleep.
As the visualizations are based on a vast dataset released by Jawbone, the makers of a digitized wristband that tracks motion and sleep behavior, the data is not necessarily representative for the whole general population.

Charting Culture [nature.com] shows the geographical movements of over 120,000 individuals who were notable enough in their life-times that the dates and locations of their births and deaths were recorded. 
The animation commences around 600 bc and ends in 2012, and tracks the life of people like  Leonardo da Vinci or Jett Travolta -- son of the actor John Travolta. It presents each person's birth place as a blue dot and their death as a red dot. Developed by Mauro Martino, research manager of the Cognitive Visualization Lab in IBM's Watson Group, the animated map is based on data retrieved from the Google-owned knowledge base, Freebase, a community-curated database of well-known people, places, and things. 
More scientific information can be found in the Science paper ""A network framework of cultural history"", which was spearheaded by Maximilian Schich and his team.

Amsterdam City Dashboard [waag.org] presents the city of Amsterdam through the lens of data, including demographic statistics, traffic reports, noise readings or political messages. 
The small collection of information graphics are divided in distinct domains, such as transport, environment, statistics, economy, social, cultural and security. All data is shown in near real-time, based on blocks of 24 hours. Larger dots and darker colors symbolize higher values, whereas an interactive map provides a geographic reference.
Based on the Linked Data API from the CitySDK project, this dashboard should be easily transferable to the data repositories from other cities.

One Human Heartbeat [onehumanheartbeat.com] by data scientist and communicator Jen Lowe displays the dynamics of Jen's heartbeat from about one day ago. 
The data is captured by a Basis B1 band, which is able to detect one's heart rate by measuring the pulse and blood flow, and then records the average heart rate for each minute. As the data currently can only be accessed via a USB connection, the data shown on the webpage is from exactly 24 hours ago.
Next to the obvious, bright red spiral of life/death in the middle of the screen, a small, numerical countdown counter reveals how many heart beats are left (at least in comparison to the US average life expectancy).

The densely populated yet beautiful HubCab [hubcab.org] by MIT Senseable Lab is an interactive map that captures the more than 170 million unique taxi trips that were made by around 13,500 taxi cabs within the City of New York in 2011. 
The map shows exactly how - and when - taxis picked up or dropped off individuals, hereby highlighting particular zones of condensed pickup and drop-off activities during specific times of day.
The map lead to the development of the concept of ""shareability networks"", which allows for the efficient modeling and optimization of the trip-sharing opportunities. The according sharing benefits consider the total fare fare savings to passengers, the distance savings in travelled miles, and the CO2 emission savings in kg of CO2 that result from potentially shared trips.

"|>>Why I'm quitting journalism|>>","|>>http://blog.schaver.com/post/72870837813|>>","|>>Today’s my last day in journalism. On Monday I begin a new career as a Foreign Service Officer for the U.S. State Department.
That will surprise some because just six months ago I quit The Courier-Journal after more than two decades there to work for the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting.
My seemingly sudden departure from KyCIR isn’t because I’m unhappy with the center, a nonprofit startup that’s part of the public radio stations in Louisville. The truth is, I feel guilty because the center has been good to me and I’m abandoning it before it’s fully up and running.
The roots of my decision go way back. I first thought about the Foreign Service in college, but put the idea aside and became a reporter instead after spending a good part of my 20s backpacking around the world. I had vague hopes of one day becoming a foreign correspondent, but marriage and family took precedence and I stayed in Kentucky, where my wife is from and my children were born.
I began thinking about the Foreign Service again five years ago, long before KyCIR had been conceived, after reading an anonymous comment on the Gannett Blog during one of the chain’s many downsizings.  The comment was by someone who described himself as a former reporter and editor who had been in his mid-50s in the early 1990s when he took early retirement and joined the Foreign Service. 
""It’s not too late,"" he wrote.
I was in my late 40s then. A few years later, as the newspaper business continued to wither away, I began studying for the Foreign Service test, the first step in a long process to be hired as a Foreign Service officer. 
In August I joined KyCIR because I was sickened by the decline and dysfunction at the CJ and wanted to move on to an organization whose only mission is to do the best possible journalism and whose founders believe that’s still the most important thing — whatever the prophets of click bait may say.
At the time, my candidacy for the Foreign Service was still pending, and there was no guarantee I would ever be offered a job. I had fallen short on my first try, failing what’s called the “oral assessment,” and with the sequester and endless Congressional squabbling over the federal budget, the Foreign Service wasn’t something I could count on. I joined KyCIR assuming there was a good chance I would still be there a decade from now.
Then, on Christmas Eve, an offer from the State Department came.  I was asked to join the Jan. 13 class for new recruits, to be an economics officer and eventually  posted to any of 265 embassies, consulates or missions overseas.
It’s hard to conceive when you’re young, but you feel disturbingly vulnerable when you’re in your early 50s and the profession you have thought about obsessively for years collapses around you, and colleagues with decades of experience are shoved out the door or forced to take drastic pay cuts to keep their jobs, with little hope of finding equivalent work elsewhere.
As much as I liked the center, I took a pay cut of more than $10,000 a year to work there, and I had no idea if its non-profit model would succeed, and if it failed before I reached retirement age, what would I do then?
When I was a teenager my family lived in Singapore and in college I had studied economics and political science, and here was an opportunity go abroad again, to be engaged in important issues in foreign lands, and — assuming I proved myself capable — to have something like job security too.
So I accepted. 
I still believe in the importance of KyCIR and its mission. I want it to succeed, and if you’re a talented data journalist with a strong interest in investigative journalism, send your resume to the managing editor, Brendan McCarthy. I’ve loved working with him and with R.G. Dunlop, a friend from my days at the CJ who reluctantly took one of Gannett’s buyouts and is now with KyCIR. I think you would too.
But as much as I value journalism, the last decade, with its endless series of budget cuts, layoffs, buy outs and furloughs and the decimation of many once-great newspapers, including the CJ, has finally driven me away.

Fully 79% of the 181 million Americans who own smartphones reach for them within 15 minutes of waking up in the morning, according to a survey last year by IDC. …
This has unhinged news consumption. In comparing preferred news sources among Americans, Pew found 68% chose television in 1991 vs. 55% in 2012, 56% chose newspapers in 1991 vs. 33% in 2012 and 54% chose radio in 1991 vs. 33% in 2012. By contrast, 30% of Americans named the Internet and mobile media as their preferred news outlets in 2012. A separate Pew study in 2013 found that the Internet is the top news choice for nearly half of those under the age of 45, as compared with the 17% in the cohort who favor newspapers.

Nearly six decades after Alan Turing’s death, the British mathematician is still celebrated as a Nazi code-breaking World War II hero and father of modern computer science. His most enduring legacy, though, may be in biology: Late in his life, Turing theorized that a particular type of chemical interaction could account for many patterns observed in nature. In subsequent decades, scientists would find these Turing patterns in everything from cheetah spots to organ formation. In the image above, Turing patterns can be seen in the development of mouse fingers, just as they’re seen in fish fin development — suggesting, say researchers, that some Turing-type mechanism is an ancestral feature of vertebrate evolution.

21st-century Korea is the most rapidly developing country in Asia, and the trend-sensitive Korean market has been an initial testing spot for global corporations in launching new products. The Korean housing market is also exhibiting a rapid change as it reflects this increasingly consumer-oriented lifestyle. This project will introduce a new possibility of an alternative residential prototype, transforming existing duplex houses to satisfy changing consumer needs. Built 23 years ago, and abandoned for the last eight years, the key point of remodeling this wrecked duplex house was to blend the two separate units and combine them into a new set with a new space composition. The needs of the client were taken into consideration, and the most applicable space composition was developed. For the elevation, some of the previous masonry walls were left showing the contrast of ""old"" and ""new"" as they blended into each other forming a unique new space. A variety of space division strategies were applied to the ""new"" wall, allowing the client’s life to seamlessly fit into this ""space canvas."" For the design of the facade, digital computation of louver module design was applied to the portion of the facade that corresponds with the interior space. ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/94/63/9463b0abe1c5ada2a93d8c86d1257fa3.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Yet, unless you’re granted an aerial view of a site via aircraft or Google Earth, this integral component of a building can sometimes go unnoticed. All of that’s about to change, Architizer is teaming with North America’s largest roofing manufacturer, GAF, to bring professionals and building owners together to compete head-to-head and discover which roofing projects are the most innovative. The competition is a rare chance for roofing projects to shine in their own regard, and allow architects, builders, owners, and users to boast how crowning a building with a compelling roof can be the most creative finishing touch on a project. Considering the popularity of GAF’s products, chances are you’ve spent many hours beneath a GAF roof. Building facades might fluctuate from traditional brick to undulating titanium, but GAF roofs have proven to be a uniting factor in the story of contemporary construction.

“… One of the most distressing aspects of our time is the total destruction of one’s consciousness of everything that is connected to a conscious perception of the beautiful,” says Andrei Tarkowski. For this young couple’s residence, the desire for a subtle confrontation with the site was the most important aspect of the design. This confrontation occurs in both directions, one of which is parallel to the lot due to the diagonal slope of the topography. Thus arises the figure of a regulating square, which expands to the perpendicular line at the front of the lot, and arrives at an axis at the diagonal of the contours. The effect achieved is one of slowly loosening the house from the ground; thereby setting the intimate area on the ground floor and creating columns on the lower floor. The difficult context of the sensitive landscape is articulated by the square that orients the home for the best sunlight and views, seeking to not set the walls, and setting different scales of spaces. We also inverted the logic of the traditional layout that consists of a social hall, living room, dining room, balcony, and entertainment area, opting for an arrival on the axis ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/fa/11/fa11968ebeee9fbacea198eafb3aa9e8.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Santiago Calatrava, the maker of fantastic skeletal structures that swoop and soar, has faced an onslaught of legal woes in the wake of his early-2000s building boom. Unfortunately, several of his experimental designs have had construction issues, leading cities and clients to seek damages. The latest is a Spanish case that claims Calatrava received $3.6 million for a convention center that he never built. To add to the architect's resume of bad publicity, he failed to show up in courts, NPR reported Thursday. Calatrava's convention center troubles were published the same day as reports arose of the decommissioning of Frank Gehry's proposal for a Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center.

Austria is a land of picturesque landscapes. The hilly terrain of western Vienna lends itself to all kinds of quintessentially Alpine pleasures: rock climbing, skiing, and unparalleled vantage points over the city. But of course, the downside to these dramatic drops are complications in building. Vienna-based architect Klaus Heissbauer’s own home, a complete renovation of a property hailing from the 1960s, sits on one of the steepest slopes in Vienna. “The hillside situation of the project was very complex,” said Heissbauer, who founded Livingpool Architecture and Design in Vienna in 2001. Despite the dramatic drop to the land, a difference of 60 feet from its highest point to its lowest, he took on his very own “Project Home” undeterred; as in the rest of Livingpool’s body of work, the terrain actually shaped the design process rather than work against it. What's more, the team somehow managed to actually complete it in record time.

Dr. Seuss would have made a killing. The device, still in prototype stages, looks like a pair of thin aluminum leg braces you strap to yourself around the waist and thighs and at the heels of your shoes, according to Smithsonian Magazine. You can stand and walk around in them as usual, and when you’re ready to sit, you lower yourself at your ideal resting position, press a button to lock its battery-operated dampers into place, and effectively rest your weight onto your heels (an alternative version stands instead by extending supports to the floor).   The device aligns your posture in the same way that a barstool would, and is just as precarious; if some unsavory character walked up and so much as nudged you on the shoulder, you’re done for.

IKEA has been very interested in the interface of digital culture and production with the traditional methods of making and selling furniture. Their ""bookbook"" video introduces their catalog as a world-changing app, in book form. Similarly, in the summer of 2004, IKEA decided to evolve from the use of traditional photography for the IKEA catalogue to its current system, where the bulk of its imagery is computer generated. Martin Enthed, the IT manager for the in-house communication agency of IKEA explained what his team does, and how CG has changed their job. “When it comes to products,” explains Martin, “IKEA of Sweden designs and develops the product range. The global marketing and communication department ... does the assembly instructions you all know so well!

That is the dream of OfficeUS — the experimental architecture office inhabiting the US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, in their proposal for a floating ""Museum-Freeport"" that would connect the Gulf of Finland Growth Triangle — Helsinki, Tallinn, and St. Petersburg — and establish a new metropolitan region beyond the existing national borders. Guggenheim Cruises would be an open seas museum and art storage facility, traveling from port to port and reaping cultural, educational, and economic benefits for the trio of cities. The various curated journeys would have a capacity of 5,000 passengers and would last between 3 and 13 hours.    The cruise ship allows patrons, travelers, collectors, and art handlers to experience art in new forms. In addition to galleries, the boat would include special performance spaces and outdoor sculpture decks. Dynamic and performative exhibitions become a standard on the floating Guggenheim.

A tiny learning center built by students has an outsized impact on city residents and provides a powerful symbol of renewal. Objectives: The Community Learning Center operated out of a tiny apartment in a public housing development for years, achieving great success in getting at-risk kids on track to graduation and college. The Center had unlimited energy and ambition but very limited space. In 2008 the Housing Authority received a state grant that would cover half the cost of a new 2,000-square-foot facility, and made arrangements with the local vocational/technical high school to provide the labor to make up the difference. A sliver of space on the edge of the development was set aside for the building. Design and Construction: Working with staff and students, we designed a simple barn-like volume with a shed roof opening up to the street. South-facing windows shaded by deciduous trees provide passive solar heating in the winter and connect the interior to the city outside.

For LTL, keeping in line with this progressive vision requires the latest advances in technology, so we’re highlighting them as part of our series on firms using tablets to take architecture to new heights. The designers at LTL are committed to turning existing structures into appealing, functional spaces that serve communities in new ways all across the country. “Almost all of our work, and this is intentional from the founding of the office, is public in nature,” says David. The firm’s list of current and recent projects speaks to this civic consideration, such as their redesign of Coney Island’s Steeplechase Pier. LTL not only addressed the damage from Hurricane Sandy, but also added playful elements to enhance the site’s status as a tourist attraction.   For the Arthouse at the Jones Center in downtown Austin, Texas, LTL Architects brought a fresh, modern look ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/f7/31/f73132ef091367ebacb68ead98db4c0c.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Designed by Philippe Starck, Hide is an indirect-light wall lamp. The body is in pressofused aluminum, with a shiny finish and injection printed diffuser in photo engraved PMMA. There are also optional enhancer trims available in various versions: colored PMMA, and panels with a choice between noble wood, metal, or photographic images. The wall lamp includes an injection printed wall attachment in PA66 and the power pack is built into the wall attachment. Lighting is by means of a specially designed Light Guide, providing an optimally oriented light flow that affords unrivaled lighting comfort. The efficiency of this innovative lighting system is of 98 percent, which means that the LEDs can be used at full power with no significant energy loss. Hide does not have dimming capacities.|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/ec/fb/ecfb81715012f31a61a447e52d277dbc.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Want to insert 3D shapes into your real world places? There's an app for that. Matter allows you to add 3D effects to your personal photos and combine effects like shadows and reflections, all with the ease we have come to expect from amateur photography apps. The new fantastic creations can then be uploaded to social media directly as photos or videos. Suddenly, the worlds of dynamic architectural renderings, sci-fi graphics, and selfie culture have become one. Video exports of short animated loops can be made with the object spinning, pulsing, and hovering in your environment. You can also rotate speed and direction for a different effect every time. For some examples, check out Matter's own Instagram.   Matter is the latest installment in the Pixite Creative Suite for mobile photo editing. The program offers four packs of 3D models, including everything from simple geometric shapes to complex, architectural structures. Like many other photo apps, Matter also allows you to select from a series of visual styles to make it reflective or refractive, opaque or translucent.    Shadows lend the 3D models ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/96/9b/969ba56ba1b7148c9dde5cc2f17d1298.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

A team led by Mexico and US-based based Fernando Romero and UK-based Norman Foster have won a competition to design the Mexico City Airport. Sponsored by the federal government of Mexico, the competition's aim was to revolutionize airport design infrastructure and to make an icon for the country of Mexico.   Images courtesy of Foster + Partners The Mexico City Airport will be a column-free space replete with natural light. Its monumental shape and symbolism are drawn from Mexican art and architecture. As passengers approach the airport form above, it will appear as a luminous orb, evoking an image of the sun. A cacti garden marks the entrance, while the roads are in the shape of an eagle and serpent, a well-known symbol of the nation's creation myth.   The building inhabits one continuous membrane, which is meant to improve the experience of flying by offering quicker and more efficient circulation with minimal cost. The proposed lightweight, prefabricated system will be manufactured in Mexico, and the resulting envelope will be one-third of the mass and three times the span of a typical airport. {% blog_media_item 961493 ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/b1/85/b1855532f7493521c80424c2809bc4db.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'art': 1})|>>"

Advancements in technology are shaping the future of our design and architecture industries. Alongside new sensors, robotics, 3D printing, and synthetic biology, crowdfunding is also transforming the way architecture is designed and created. For those who (somehow) don't already know, crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people. Most recently, crowdfunding is occurring via the internet using platforms including Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Fundrise, and Fundable. Within the architecture industry, crowdfunding offers a new realm of experimentation; James Ramsey, Principal of RAAD and creator of the Lowline project (the world’s first underground park) utilized Kickstarter in order to establish if their idea might gain traction. And it did — that round of funding allowed for the creation of their conceptual prototype, and the project is due for completion in 2018.  Image via Lowline Based on this patronage model for a generation of DIY lovers, architects are using innovative platforms and legislation to usher in an era for creative financing. Crowdfunding allows the architect or designer to take a small risk that would normally be considered ""high risk"" by traditional methods of financing.

The heart of Pandora’s new office in Midtown Manhattan is a bright, double-height space first visible through a low, compressed entry. This central space provides a physical connection between the two floors via the grand stair on one side and takes advantage of the full height of both floors — about 25 feet — with a large screen made of translucent circular discs, elegantly coupled with figured aluminum hooks backed by a blue theatrical scrim. These elements combine to create a screen of an indeterminate scale designed to deliberately obscure the existing architectural elements and create a first impression of grandeur. A large “tree” made of LED bulbs references the marquee lights of music venues and leads the eye upward, suggesting growth. On the north and south sides of the block-long floor plate are the open desk areas, each identified by a color and populated by faceted glass volumes that provide private meeting spaces and small “phone booths” for a relief from the activity of the open areas. These “crystals” invite multiple paths of movement around them, establishing a sequence of tight and loose spaces that are shaped to encourage casual interaction. The glass is peppered with a dot-matrix graphic ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/31/a5/31a5d249c31dad7e67d4cf67b71a10ea.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

This new four-story academic center — consolidating campus administration and enrollment services into a single, modern facility — is intentionally sited to reinforce a student/pedestrian corridor connecting student housing with core academic facilities. The building supplants a previous surface parking lot, restoring the rigorous urban fabric that is a legacy of this metropolitan campus. Its central location, connected to the student center and adjacent to the library, enables the building to leverage its location to maximize visibility and convenience for both students and visitors. Charged with creating an environment of openness, convenience, and accessibility for students and visitors, the building form and materials are manipulated on the south facade to respond to the prominence of the adjacent student pedestrian axis. Interior public circulation is consolidated within a four-story atrium to the south, which parallels interior movement and activity with that along the exterior pedestrian corridor. Cladding this form in a glass curtain wall system of varying opacity emphasizes openness and transparency, and creates a visual connection between students inside and out. The Student Services Center was awarded LEED® “Gold” Certification for the sustainable features that were rigorously integrated into the building.   {% ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/83/eb/83eb5c4ce5d6c469e286e2f4f271d782.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Don't mess with the AIA (or your local licensing board). And if you were planning to covertly build college campus buildings without a license, think again. A French self-proclaimed architect narrowly avoided jail time after it was discovered that he had been building schools and homes for almost 30 years while pretending to be qualified as a licensed practitioner. He was given a two-year suspended sentence by the court.  Images via TVFIL78 But here's the story's hitch: Philippe Leblanc's buildings were actually pretty good. They are simple, effective modernist buildings, and reportedly, ""in general, the buildings were constructed without problems.”  Perhaps Leblanc had simply got caught up in a whirlwind of work, and never completed his diploma. Despite not clearing this small hurdle, Leblanc forged ahead, designing buildings and stamping drawings with his licensed brother-in-law's stamp. He plans to complete his degree this summer.  These shenanigans were discovered when some dissatisfied clients began asking around. The court's suspended sentence is augmented by a set of 1,000-3,000 Euro fines for ""abuse of confidence."" Leblanc's lawyer's retort? “That is confirmation that even if my client had no diploma, his buildings ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/71/e3/71e3088b7f48dadaffff7a75a931f258.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

The lot in question has a total area of 6,995 square feet. The house is comprised of a ground floor and a first floor. The volume follows the principles defined by the housing development, occupying a central area of the land (970 square feet), and leaving a portion for a gardened area. The entrance proceeds through a gate to the north, followed by a granite slab that greets the visitor, leading inside the house through the side facade oriented to the east. The interior space is organized according to a model of a ground floor (public space) plus first floor (private space). Following an intuitive logic, at the entrance of the house is the hall, which is bordered on one side by the kitchen, office, and sanitary service, and on the other side by the living room. It is also possible to visually follow the path of the stairs to the upper floor that is presented frontally, with a stone wall outlining it from the living room. The kitchen provides direct contact with the street through glass, while the lounge area opens onto the back of the house, to the south, giving access to an outdoor area with a swimming ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/9f/a1/9fa12aefcf04b3a128ce8d0374886125.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Since its completion in the 1930s, the Citroën Garage in Brussels, often referred to as the “Cathedral for Cars,” has always been about the future. Thomas Stroobants, an architect specializing in historic monuments and sites spent four months documenting the building’s original design by Maurice Ravazé, Alexis Dumont, and Marcel Van Goethem. “They were constantly thinking about the future and how it could look,” Stroobants says, “and this is exactly one of those buildings representing a very bright future.”  Stroobants and his team also investigated the changes made to the building over the years, and its present-day potential as part of a research project for the Raymond Lemaire International Centre for Conservation. After completing their research, Stroobants’ team chose the unique self-publishing platform Blurb to showcase their work and to stir up public opinion about what’s next for this fascinating landmark.  Stroobants was first attracted to the Garage because of the interesting way people deal with buildings recently recognized as historical sites. “When you work on a very ancient monument, it’s obvious that it has a certain value,” he says, “when it’s not even a hundred years old, it’s always very different ...|>>","|>>https://acdn.architizer.com/thumbnails-PRODUCTION/53/a5/53a534cd9714f92675ecc74a0062b2d9.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

The Gouldian finch are small, brightly colored birds with green backs, yellow bellies, and purple breasts  with a light blue uppertail and a cream undertail. Sometimes called lady gouldians, their facial color can vary, but black is the most common. Gouldian finch chicks are equipped with blue phosphorescent beads along their mouths, making it easy for the parents to feed them in the darkness of the nest cavity.

Ah, the circle of life. Thirty years ago, Bill Gates visited Nokia to check out its latest MikroMikko personal computer — competition to IBM's own line of (Microsoft-powered) PCs in the ‘80s. No one could have guessed back then that IBM would bow out of the PC hardware market and that Microsoft would buy Nokia itself decades later. There is one thing we should have seen coming, however: those large-frame glasses were always destined to fall out of style.

Are you paranoid that strangers are using drones, security cameras, hidden microphones, or even Google Glass to spy on you? If so, you might be interested in a little device called Cyborg Unplug. Just stick it into a power outlet and watch as it sounds an alarm whenever such a surveillance device enters the vicinity of your home. Even better, you can lock those devices from connecting to your Wi-Fi network. If you're really looking to make a statement, you can even show those ""Glassholes"" who's boss by preventing all surveillance devices near your Cyborg Unplug from connecting to any Wi-Fi network.
The device is really just a tiny router the size of an old Apple Airport Express that's had its firmware customized to sniff out and block...

""Dr. Kong"" has been defeated. Competitive gamer Robbie Lakeman has snatched the world record for the highest ever Donkey Kong score from Hank Chien. Chien, a plastic surgeon in New York, has held sole possession of the title for nearly four years — earning himself the nickname Dr. Kong. Late Thursday night, Lakeman completed a over three-hour session and earned a score of 1,141,800 — 3,200 points better than Chien's prior record. The next day, according to Donkey Blog, he called Dr. Kong himself to tell him to relinquish his crown.
The world record for the original arcade version of Donkey Kong, dating from 1981, has been hotly contested for decades. Competitive players sink thousands of hours into mastering the game — and hoping for a...

I’ve already written about the subtle but important upgrade that Samsung made to its Note series with the addition of a metal frame to the new Note 4 and Note Edge devices. But preceding them on the announcement calendar was the similarly metal-rimmed Galaxy Alpha, which until today looked like a promising alternative to the Galaxy S5. Now that I’ve held it in my hands, I can say it’s so much more than that.

Sam Smith's Stay With Me is all over the radio, and you're almost sure to have heard it by now. That's not a bad thing, per se. It's a perfectly fine song. There's just nothing especially new to it, since it's probably right to compare his sound to Adele and other pop-soul acts of the last decade. For those of us looking for something new, though, FKA twigs (who you might remember from last week's Weekender) took Smith's hit, and, by infusing some space-y, sexy trip-hop elements, blasted it into the future. The world needs more of this and in a hurry.

Oculus will not tell me when the long-awaited consumer version of its Rift headset, beloved by PC gamers and dedicated virtual reality enthusiasts, might be released.
“I know it’s coming,” says company CEO and co-founder Brendan Iribe when I finally ask the question. “No comment. We’re really excited about Gear VR right now.” He’s talking about Oculus’ new attempt to attract casual virtual reality users that the Rift might put off: a partnership with Samsung that turns a Galaxy Note 4 into...

The folks at Pixar are masters of visual storytelling, and color is just one element in their toolkit that helped movies Up and Finding Nemo sail over the competition. (Nevermind the better scripts and not having to rely on star-studded casts. I'm looking right at you, Shark Tale.) Vimeo user Rishi Kaneria made this supercut celebrating color in your favorite Pixar movies. Enjoy.

There's been a steady stream of leaks leading up to this Tuesday's Apple press conference, but now it appears we're getting our best look yet at the next iPhone. A user on Chinese social media site Weibo has posted a series of photos (via cnBeta) that purport to show a fully-functional, activated iPhone 6. While the authenticity of the photos can not be confirmed, the images do not appear to be tampered. The leaker has also uploaded a brief video demonstrating Touch ID on the device, suggesting the this is, in fact, a legitimate iPhone 6.
The images appear to depict a new iPhone with roughly a 4.7-inch screen. This isn't the first time we've seen this device — several earlier part leaks have already given us a good idea of what the...

Thousands of people running small blogs and websites over the years have received threatening letters from Getty Images for using its professional photos without a license, but now the photo service is going after something a little bigger: Microsoft. Getty Images filed a lawsuit this week against Microsoft, claiming that its new Bing ""Image Widget"" tool constitutes ""massive infringement"" of copyrighted images. The company has asked a US District Court judge to shut down the widget and award unspecified damages, according to Reuters.
Bing ""Image Widget"" launched just a couple of weeks ago in beta form. It lets users embed an active slideshow or grid of image search results on their sites just as easily as adding an embedded YouTube...

I came, I saw, and I still don't know what Samsung has conquered. Creating a 105-inch TV that can bend on command is an undeniable feat of engineering, but it doesn't seem like anyone stopped to ask why we'd actually want one. Samsung's massive new prototype TV takes pride of place in the entryway to the company's grand IFA venue. It flexes back and forth between a flat and curved state with a smooth and unhurried motion. There's a pretty lady to one side and a blue-shirted demo dude to the...

Tehran architecture studio Next Office has designed and built a house that has bedrooms that can pivot at the touch of a button. 

Named The Sharifi-ha House, this house has three bedrooms on three floors that can swivel 90 degrees to face inward or outward based on the season. 

As the rooms pivot, their interiors change drastically to either feature a large open ‘terrace’, or a room with minimal openings and light. This is a modern interpretation of old Iranian mansions with both summer and winter living rooms.

The rooms are motorized with a turning mechanism that is similar to what is used in car showrooms.

“I started doing this around three years ago. As for my reasons, during the great earthquake, people forgot how to smile. I wanted to help bring the smiles back, and that’s why I started,” he told BBC News.

FROM A PAINTING – AMANDA BLAKE

London and Vienna-based fashion designer Sabinna started a project with her engineer boyfriend David to recreate looks and outfits from famous paintings. 

The idea first came to the couple during a trip to an exhibition where they realized that Sabinna was “wearing the exact same dress and make-up as one of the painted ladies,” and from there, the project was born. 

They use accessories and clothes that closely resemble those in the paintings and the results are quite impressive. Some of the recreations are uncanny and through this project, it actually shows that paintings can be a great source for fashion inspiration.

GIFs that show iconic movie references recreated in the popular show are listed in the blog, together with the original clip from the movie that is used.

While some scenes from classic movies are hidden like Easter eggs, others are rather obvious, such as the door hacking scene from The Shining, and Mary Poppins “flying” up the banister.

Thomas Wagner, professor for virtual design at the University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, wondered if a synchronized virtual ride could substitute for the real environment.

Thus, he explored his idea with the help of German rollercoaster manufacturer Mack Rides, and the ‘Augmented Thrill Ride Project’ was born.

Named ‘VR Coaster’, individuals are to don an Oculus Rift headset while riding a rollercoaster. They can shoot asteroids or visualize a flying Pegasus as the real-life rollercoaster ride takes place.

Results have been promising.

Roping in over 50 people into the project and after more than a hundred test rides, the new synchronized ride was reported to have “no problems” even for individuals who are afraid of rollercoasters or have a tendency for motion sickness.

Lingerie brand Nubian Skin has redefined the meaning of “nude” by releasing a line of underwear and hosiery catering to women of color.

Most nude clothing and make-up is based on a Caucasian skin tone, which includes anything from ivory to camel, and darker bronzed shades at the most, but not much beyond that color spectrum.

In a blog post, the brand’s intern Mary described the difficulties black and brown women face in the lingerie section.

“Despite the reality that women of color have the same needs as all women when it comes to lingerie and hosiery (and spend the same of their hard-earned money), the industry simply doesn’t cater to us.”

Nubian Skin’s inclusive lingerie line will be available from its website in October.

As a run-up to its release, the brand posted a series of images to Instagram showing models clad in underwear reflecting their skin tone.

The company hopes this will encourage people to rethink what “nude” means.

What do you think of Nubian Skin’s effort—isn’t it wonderful?

Visual arts student Emma Sulkowicz will be performing an endurance art piece titled ‘Mattress Performance: Carry That Weight’, for her senior thesis at the Columbia University.

The piece doubles as a protest against the school's lack of imposed consequences on the man who has raped her in her dorm room—apparently, many American colleges are notorious for pressuring victims into not making a report of such attacks to the police.

Sulkowicz pledges to carry the mattress everywhere she goes, until her alleged attacker moves off the campus or when the school expels him.

Through the performance, she hopes that people would see how this issue weighs a person down, both literally and figuratively, as she remains burdened with the daunting memories of the horrific experience.

Auto insurance provider Esurance has created an ad (which has been taken down) that reminds us of the importance of proper kerning.

Placed in Chicago, it carried a seemingly harmless message: “Cover your home in a click”. 

However, when viewed from afar, the letters “c” and “l” in the word “click” looks like the letter “d”, forming the sentence “cover your home in a dick”.

According to Adweek, someone even went to Photoshop the billboard, replacing the word “click” with the actual word “dick”, and shared it on Twitter.

Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, known for his creating the popular giant rubber duckie, has created another enormous sculpture. This time, it is of a hippopotamus, named ‘HippopoThames’, which was named after the River Thames.

The 21-meter-long sculpture is made with wooden panels, and was built at the Royal Docks in Eastern London—it will be floating in the waters of Nine Elms on the South Bank, from now through 28 September 2014, as part of the Totally Thames festival.

Hofman hopes to inspire conversations through his work, and give viewers a pleasant break from their daily routines.

Watch the video below to see how the ‘HippopoThames’ was constructed, and head over to the artist's website for more of his wonderful creations.

A giant rabbit has descended in Taiwan for the upcoming Mid-Autumn festival of the Chinese lunar calendar happening next week.

The 82-foot white rabbit sculpture is the work of Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, who was also behind his world exhibition of the giant rubber duck and the ongoing gigantic floating hippo. The sculpture is made out of waterproof paper, styrofoam and wood.

Said to be Hofman’s depiction of the lunar rabbit in traditional folklore of the Chinese festival, the massive rabbit appears to be “contemplating about life and creating its own dreams” as it lies idyllic in the middle of a farmland.

Ladies, if you have a Tinder account, you may want to think twice before posting your duck face selfies—unless you do not mind having it parodied online.

Australian blogger Jarrod Allen recreated his own versions of some of the weirdest, funniest, and sexiest profile pictures posted by female users on Tinder, a popular dating platform.

What makes his photos even more amusing is his use of low budget materials to recreate these women's photos—he often nailed their poses too.

Check out Allen’s hilarious photos below, or follow him on Tumblr and Instagram for more updates.

Captain America (2012) #25 variant cover

October is National Bullying Prevention month and to raise awareness for it, Marvel has teamed up with bullying prevention organization Stomp Out Bullying to create special variant covers featuring some of its most popular superheroes.

“...bullying transcends race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation; in fact, some of Marvel's greatest super heroes were themselves bullied as kids and teens,” said Stomp Out Bullying on their collaboration with Marvel. “But just as Spider-Man, Captain America, and Marvel’s many other Super Heroes were able to triumph and go on to combat evil, so can every one of us be a Super Hero in our own right by standing up and joining the fight to eradicate bullying.”

The variant covers feature superheroes such as Captain America, Hulk and Star-Lord coming to the aid of bullied individuals.

Check out the brilliant covers below:


Rocket Raccoon (2014) #4 variant cover


Guardians of the Galaxy (2013) #20 variant cover


Hulk (2014) #7 variant cover

Krefeld, Germany-based artist Bettina Güber, who previously imagined toys having fun with office stationery, has captured gorgeous close-ups of rain-soaked flowers in her backyard after a storm.

Appropriately titled ‘Wednesday Evening’ after the date they were taken, the simple but exquisitely executed series features flowers and leaves covered in raindrops, rendered in stunning detail.

Güber told PetaPixel she was drawn to the beautiful light and the brilliant, shimmering orbs of water.

Shot with a Nikon D7000 and an AFS Micro NIKKOR 40mm f/2.8G lens, the photographer said the images were as close to the original in-camera ones, adding that she only darkened the background slightly during editing.

Creative agency Anagrama has created a minimalist yet striking identity for Monterrey-based clinic Boreálica, which specializes in using extremely low temperatures for medical treatment.

To reflect this unique characteristic of the practice, Anagrama used a cool palette of white and grey, which is complemented by the lovely effect of holographic foil—from different angles, the foil on the business card alternates between several frosty, shimmering colors. 

Inspired by the North and South Poles, this simple and elegant identity also features a monogram, a rounded “O”, that is based on the traditional symbol for temperature.

From 1933 to 1936, San Francisco-born photographer Peter Stackpole watched as construction was carried out on the San-Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

A huge public works project that had been decades in the making, the steel structure was the largest and most expensive of its kind at that time.

His amazing, vertigo-inducing photographs document its progress during the three years, capturing the workers who risked their lives to build it, with nary a safety harness in sight as they toiled high up in the air.

The images launched the career of the then-20-something Stackpole, who would later become one of Life Magazine’s first staff photographers.

Check out some of his photographs below.

In Chris Keeney’s latest photo book, titled Petcam: The World Through the Lens of Our Four-Legged Friends, the photographs were not shot by him. Instead, he enlisted the help of his pet dog and cat, and other animals like cows, chickens, and pigs from all over the world to take the pictures for him.

After attaching small, lightweight cameras to the collars of these animals, the San Diego-based photographer amassed a quirky collection of photos that showed the surroundings that the animals run and play in from their point of view.

You would not have guessed that some of the photos were taken by animals, if not for obvious details like a dog’s tongue peeking through a corner of a photo.

Visual.ly has created a thought-provoking infographic that touches on two controversial topics: religion and capital punishment.

Titled ‘A Guide to the Wrath of God’, it points out crimes that are punishable by death in various religious texts. The religions featured include Christianity/Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism and Confucianism.

“The holy texts of most major religions are quite violent in nature,” wrote Visual.ly in a post. “And, while it may seem barbaric today, the death penalty was a common means of dealing with what could be perceived as even a minor offense.”

“It’s important to remember that these texts, written in antiquity, are, by their nature, open to interpretation. Your interpretation may not be the same as ours. Different interpretations exist, and may lead to harsher or milder punishments.”

The team at Wired went behind the scenes at the Crayola factory to find out how crayons were created.

The factory produces up to 12 million sticks of colored crayons every day—paraffin wax gets steam-heated, and filtered through barrels where technicians will add in powdered pigments and additives. It is then passed onto a rotary mold for 110 crayons to get labels and sorted according to its color.

Watch video to see the fascinating process of crayons being made.

Belgian photographer Maroesjka Lavigne’s series ‘You are More than Beautiful’ examines the social pressure to be beautiful in Seoul.

The obsession with beauty stems from the South Korean capital’s highly competitive society, where it is regarded as a symbol of wealth and status, and used as a tool to get ahead in all aspects of life.

This relentless pursuit of physical perfection has led to a booming plastic surgery industry, which is further fueled by celebrities who go under the knife to attain double eyelids, straight noses and slim, pointed chins.

“From getting into the best schools, to landing a good job, to finding a man and to having a wealthy life, there is never a moment’s peace. People are competing with each other all the time. And of course, beauty plays a key part in this competition. In Seoul, a picture on your school or job application is a must. Girls get nose jobs as a graduation gift in order to get a better job.”

Lavigne’s poignant photographs capture the extent of this trend, from young women undergoing surgery, and television screens and billboards advertising plastic surgery procedures, to girls checking their appearance in a nightclub.

View some images from her series below.

These cakes resemble little villages. Each cake can be joined with another using chocolate bridges, which will be given to customers. They will be rolled out during the holiday season to remind people to return home for Christmas.

“Christmas is about homecoming, about spending time together with family, so we created a cake that's a small village, composed of houses clustered closely together. We thought the winter wonderland scene would emphasise the warmth and cheer inside each home.”

The Telefontornet, or Telephone Tower, in Stockholm was a 45-meter high steel building which was in use from 1887 to 1913.

Built to serve as the city’s telephone junction, the structure was covered in 5,000 telephone wires that connected its residents.

It remained standing after it was decommissioned in 1913, but was torn down in 1953 after suffering heavy damage in a fire.

Renowned American photographer Annie Leibovitz has captured famous figures in their homes for New York City-based real estate firm The Corcoran Group’s ‘Live Who You Are’ ad campaign.

The ads feature well-known personalities relaxing in the comfort of their homes, from ballerina Misty Copeland lounging on her couch to NBA superstar Tyson Chandler sharing a sweet moment with his family.

They were shot in the affluent Manhattan, Brooklyn, Hamptons and Palm Beach neighborhoods served by the company.

Given that real estate ads typically focus on a property’s amenities and location, the photographs are a refreshing change from the usual run-of-the-mill marketing—we think Leibovitz has done an admirable job conveying a warm and personable feel with these images.

Introducing the catalog in a way that looks very similar to how Apple would launch one of its smart devices, this funny short film calls the catalog a “bookbook” that is “simple and intuitive” to use.

According to the “Chief Design Guru” in the video, it is superior to any digital book with its “eternal battery life”, “tactile touch technology”, pre-installed home furnishing ideas, zero page-loading lag time and useful bookmarking function.

Watch this tongue-in-cheek video below—are you convinced that a “bookbook” is better than a smart device now?

Unlike the Google Glass, Baidu Eye does not come with a screen—it sends information to the user’s smartphone instead.

According to Kaiser Kuo, Baidu’s director of international communications, Baidu Eye is screen-less as they found that “screens impair vision and tire your eyes easily.”

What are the worse things you’ve heard from a creative director?

Bodhisatwa Dasgupta, a creative director himself, said, “While a lot of creative directors say the most sensible and wise things, many are downright daft. They say idiotic things. I just wanted to chronicle a few of them.”

If you are tired of having conventional photo booths at your events, how about using this cool light-painting photo booth instead?

Created by France-based collective Dazler, lightOmatic is a unique, interactive photo booth that combines light painting with photography.

Instead of just capturing candid photos, you can now jazz them up by creating light paintings or drawings by using handheld LEDs.

The two minute-exposure window in the photo booth lets you “draw” as many patterns and shapes as you like. Once the exposure ends, simply pose for the single flash shot. The final image will reflect your cool drawings juxtaposed with your drawings.

Would you want to take your photos in the lightOmatic? According to PetaPixel, rental prices start at $5,000.

Check out the lightOmatic in the video below.

Photographer Sanne De Wilde captured a group of albinos, highlighting their unique beauty in her project, ‘Snow White’.

De Wilde, whom we featured previously, approached her subjects with a delicate hand—besides showing their fair features, she intended to make us question about the way we view these light-sensitive albinos.

“I try to present it as a fragile physical state, an unwanted mask, but at the same time as a powerful metaphor for the ‘other’…They become a metaphor, a symbol for stereotypes; they magnify the erroneous idea of human weaknesses and physical fragility but also that of (un)earthly, breathtaking beauty,” said De Wilde.

Mobile application Onefootball, which serves as a platform for the global football community, has recently moved into a new themed office designed by TKEZ Architects.

The Berlin-based office, which features a football theme, has an eye-catching, white-striped artificial green-way that navigates through the office.

Once an old factory, the spacious, newly renovated office still retains an industrial vibe, with concrete flooring, high ceilings, and floor length windows. 

Floor decals in the patterns of arrows and markings are also plastered in certain areas of the office to resemble a football team’s playbook. 

For the employees, the architects created a recreation area in the form of a mini football arena that allows them to watch games from all over the world. 

Onefootball hopes that the new office environment will make “its employees not merely feel active, but spontaneous—to act on creative impulse and to utilize their colleagues for an interdisciplinary, team-based approach”.

The Sydney Morning Herald has sparked outrage, after the 183-year-old newspaper decided to use Comic Sans on its front page.

The decision to use the typeface was considered appropriate, as it was used in cartoon speech bubbles, to match the comic-book feel that the newspaper was trying to create, as a “mockery of the appalling displays in the witness box from a former [Australian] politician and current parliamentarian”, explained Darren Goodsir, Editor in Chief for The Sydney Morning Herald, in his email to Buzzfeed. 

Members of the public have since been mocking this move mercilessly and giving making negative comments about the newspaper on Twitter.

Talk about s*** happening. Kent, United Kingdom-based new dad Al Ferguson literally got an armful of it when his infant son Ted unexpectedly pooped on him during a family photo shoot last month.

The little tyke was sleeping while cradled in Ferguson’s arms when he suddenly let loose all over over his dad’s arms and the family’s shag carpet.

“We had just taken the shot we wanted when I felt his tummy tense up and the explosion went off,” Ferguson told Mashable.

He managed to maintain a sense of humor about the whole thing, once the initial shock of being shat on wore off.

Quipped the bemused dad, “I think we will blow it up big and put it on the wall in his nursery. It’s not every day you see a picture like this!”

The Ferguson family photographs were taken by UK photographer Kirsty Grant.

Los Angeles-based photographer Amy Elkins’ latest project ‘Danseur’ explores masculinity and gender stereotypes in dance.

For her on-going series, Elkins captured portraits of young and adult male contemporary and ballet dancers in Copenhagen. They are currently working towards or are already professional dancers.

She shot them moments after intensive training sessions, reasoning that the winding down period would soften their impression of their surroundings, and make them more relaxed in front of the camera.

Appearing weary, pensive and serious, her subjects might not conform to traditional notions of manhood as dictated by society. Nevertheless, they display a steely, if feminine, outlook that challenges typical ideas of masculinity to form their own identity.

“Any male or female that looks past the boundaries of what society deems masculine or feminine push these gender stereotypes. Men that reveal a vulnerability, fragility or femininity are pushing these boundaries.”

Online retail giant Amazon has unveiled a redesigned login page, its first major design change in a decade.

The new login page appears to have been designed with mobile users in mind, with a cleaner, streamlined interface and larger buttons. It also does away with extras like the “sign in help” links, the Amazon password question, and the secure server indicator.

Given that its old login page was designed back in the ’90s, the redesign can be viewed as a sign the company is finally moving with the times.

Italian architect and illustrator Federico Babina, who we featured recently, is back with another series of works.

Called ‘Artistect’, this new series is about “combining” famous artworks with 20th century architecture. 

Some of the pair-ups include Salvador Dali and Jan Kaplický, Kazimir Malevich and Zaha Hadid, as well as Pablo Picasso and Le Corbusier.

“The idea was to carefully study the expressive language of an artist and read between the lines the hidden architecture in it, to find the probable and improbable connections between forms of expression and aesthetic languages,” Babina told Dezeen. 

Check out the artworks below and view the rest here.

French artist François Delarozière, together with a French theatre company La Machine, had created a massive fire-breathing machine.

The kinetic sculpture is created in the form of a horse and a dragon, called ‘Long Ma’— it will be presented as a gift from France to China, to mark the upcoming 50th anniversary of the country's diplomatic relations.

Not only will it be capable of breathing fire and maneuvering majestically, the 40-foot-tall sculpture is extremely expressive, from being fiercely intimidating to looking endearingly loyal.

Watch the video below to see ‘Long Ma’ in action.

26-year-old Winchester Lyngkhoi carries fresh meat up to his butcher’s stall on market day. When asked if it was hard to live with so much rain, he replied, “We can’t think about that. Here there’s always rain but we have to work, so it’s no good wondering about it.”

New Zealand-based photographer Amos Chapple, who previously shot a leafy ‘tunnel of love’ in Ukraine, has photographed Meghalaya, India, dubbed the “wettest place on Earth.”

You might think that a place where it’s constantly raining would be a lousy photography spot; on the contrary, this makes it fertile ground for unique images that are unlikely to be captured anywhere else in the world.

The village of Mawsynram in the state receives 467 inches of rain annually. Laborers living there wear knups, umbrella-shaped hats made from bamboo and banana leaves, to protect themselves from being soaked while they go about their work.

Another distinctive feature is the use of “living bridges”, which are actually the roots of rubber trees that locals have been “training” and using as transportation for centuries.

The roots strengthen over time as they grow, making them sturdier and longer-lasting than man-made structures.

Scroll down to see some images of this fascinating community, and view more at The Atlantic.


The village of Mawsnyram, which is perched atop a ridge in the Khasi Hills in India’s northeast, claims to have the highest average rainfall on Earth. It receives 467 inches of rain annually. The heavy rainfall is due to summer air currents passing over steaming floodplains in Bangladesh, gathering moisture as they move north. When the clouds reach the hills of Meghalaya, they are forced through the narrow gap in the atmosphere to the point where they cannot hold their moisture anymore, resulting in torrential rainfall.


Laborers wearing knups clearing rockfall after heavy rain the night before in Mawsynram. They are tasked with keeping the roads passable until October when the rainy season ends, and heavy machinery can be used to carry out repairs. They earn $2.60 a day.


Local boys walk over a tree root bridge currently being forged, deep in the jungle near Mawsynram. The skeleton of the bridge is bamboo, with tendrils from the surrounding rubber trees being fixed onto the structure strand by strand. According to locals, the tree roots will still be able to support a person’s weight even after the bamboo has rotted away within 6 to 8 years.


Aside from the bridges, the jungles beneath Mawsynram hide “living ladders” curled into shape to assist villagers descending the steep Khasi hills.

Jake Knapp, a design partner at Google Ventures, recently wrote an article on Fast Co. Design, where he shares a step-by-step guide to holding better, more effective meetings.

Naming his method “note-and-vote”, he details how organizations can prevent groupthink at meetings, so as to make good decisions without sapping the time and energy of those involved.

Basically, ideas are generated privately by the various individuals at the meeting before the top ones are put to a vote by the group.

According to Knapp, “the note-and-vote isn’t perfect… but it is fast. And quite likely better than what you’d get with two hours of the old way”.

You might have seen a few of these dandy gentlemen on the streets, but have you wondered about the stories behind their stylish attire?

Photographer Rose Callahan, together with writer Nathaniel Adams, explored the colorful world of dandyism by meeting several men from the streets of  New York, London, Paris, and the West Coast.

In her photos, the dandy, well-groomed men were usually pictured in stylish get-ups of “three-piece suits with flawlessly folded pocket handkerchiefs”, “trimmed beards”, “pomade” and “velvet slippers”.

Callahan and Adams then compiled their photos and stories, revealing the hard work and sacrifices these men go through as they pursue their dandyism lifestyle in I Am Dandy: The Return of the Elegant Gentleman.

According to Callahan, these dandy gentlemen do not identify themselves as a subculture nor label themselves as “dandies"".

“They all try to be fiercely individual and go about it in their own way. It’s more like a male archetype. The idea of the ‘peacock’ has been around forever, and I think that’s where this comes from and that’s why it’s so diverse.”

Scroll down to view portraits of the gentlemen featured in Callahan’s and Adam’s book, which is available for purchase here.

"|>>Breathing Earth: How and Why|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2014/06/breathing-earth-how-and-why.html|>>","|>>Breathing EarthThis project surprised me in a number of ways, not least of which was the response.  It has become the most visited item around this site and I thought it would be fun to show how it was made, with the hopes that it sparks some makiness in you.Accidental ZoetropeOne day last summer I had the opportunity to show Joshua Stevens, a cartographer I really admire, how I make severe basemaps using NASA imagery.  When I pulled up the NASA Visible Earth page (a great resource for beautiful per-month satellite imagery mosaics of earth) and scrolled down, I noticed the thumbnails dance like a zoetrope of polar ice creeping up and down.Mental bookmark, this could be a fun project and it shouldn't take long.  As I found out later, I wasn't the first to think of this, not surprisingly.  But I was the first to do it this way.The serendipitous zoetrope effect of dancing thumbnails as I scroll down.Spatial ResuscitationSo I downloaded all twelve months and georectified them so that they were spatially aware and I could play with warping them into all sorts of geographic projections.  I ultimately chose an Azimuthal projection, centered over the North Pole, because it was sphere-like but I also benefited from not loosing all of the coverage of mid-latitudes at the horizon (which I would have if I'd used a truer spherey projection).  And the fact that the projection made Earth look a little trippier than if you were just seeing it as a globe was a plus.I used ArcMap to re-project and export the images.  ArcMap has a lot of export options, including the ability to define a transparency color and define any crazy resolution you want.Plate carrée is a convenient starting projection, but shouldn't be used for a finished map (unless you track satellite telemetry).Good old Polar Azimuthal.  Definitely not a true globe perspective but I don't lose the interesting bits in the lower latitudes that would have otherwise wrapped off into the horizon.One projected polar-projected image, per month, out of the GIS and into the image processor.Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!  When I scroll down in the file explorer I got a flipbook sense for the ice movement.  This just might work!AssemblyI put all twelve satellite images into Fireworks and aligned them on top of each other; one per layer.  I get teased, but I like Fireworks.  I'm used to it and it seems to do anything I need.  But there is nothing here that you couldn't do in Photoshop or Gimp.Once I added all the images I added a layer over-top filled with an elliptical fade overlay to vignette out the edges of the maps and set up the round look of the finished earth.Stacking, aligning, and cropping the raw exported images.Then I slightly desaturated the imagery -as is my way.  Desaturating imagery creates a more epic feel and teases out tonal variability that might otherwise be overwhelmed by hue.  I learned about this by watching the making-of DVD extras for The Fellowship of the Ring, where a post-processing artist said that in order to make the Shire feel greener they actually reduced the green band.  I thought that was wonderful.Desaturating ratchets up an oddly paired sense of intimacy and distance, used to tremendous effect in Saving Private Ryan.Pulling down the color saturation of the imagery has emotional and practical benefits. Next I drew in some atmospheric haze around the horizon.  It's just a stack of circles of lighter to darker colors that I added increasing rates of Gaussian blur to.  If you've never tried this you should, it is really fun.  Atmospheric perspective was one of the Renaissance painters greatest gifts.  It creates the sense that this disk has depth -all of the sudden it becomes a thing, rather than a snapshot.  Which is, like, the whole point.Ohhh forced atmospheric perspective.  You had me at hello.Then I added sources and a title -my least favorite part of the process is a title, but an important one.  I also included a small tic sequence to indicate the progression through the year, which I'll describe in the animation section below.  This one is showing December, so the first tic is highlighted.Title and sources.  A short but descriptive name greases the skids of social share-ability. AnimationBecause animated GIFs (I use the hard G pronunciation, even though it's wrong, because that's how it's sounded in my mind for 15 years and Jiff is peanut butter) are hard-stop frames the effect is naturally really rigid.  So between each month, I hacked a transition frame which is just the next image in line at 50% opacity.  At the right pace, the twitchiness of an animated GIF is reduced. Humans are really bad at change detection.  I found that 7/100ths of a second resulted in the most natural and organic pace for the annual animation -after trying a kajillion other frame rates.  My criteria was that I find a balance where I could look at the whole earth and its pulse would seem smooth but unhurried.  I also wanted to be able to look at any one spot and track it through the whole animation without it feeling like I was waiting too long to ride one full cycle.Adding intermediate between-month frames to make the animation smoother.ResultsWhen I generated the initial animation and opened it up the first time, I was taken aback.  I was hoping for a jee whiz sort of image but even though I was well aware of the process and the tricks, it evoked all sorts of personal senses of time and family and perspective on the pace of my life.  I went into somewhat embarrassing, but sincere, detail about that here, and I was honored (and relieved) to see that it had an effect on others, too.In any case, if you've read this far, I hope you are inspired to give something like this a shot and pour your own sort of craziness into it.  It was definitely fun for me to look back on how this was made and reminisce on the process and I hope selfishly that reviewing this will help me get back to making again.  It's been a while!Click here to see the large version (1.4 MB).Click here to see the bonkers version (3.7 MB).Don't click this small version or this tiny version.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-H_LlE69Tf_s/U6LMqvXkLGI/AAAAAAAADKE/rmInEMlK7PU/s1600/NASApage.jpg|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"
"|>>9 Things|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2014/05/9-things.html|>>","|>>I work at a software company, making things and helping others make things.  I'd say my contributions to the maki-ness are an even split of three areas: software UX design, customization UX design, and data visualization; as such, I get a pretty even split of conferring with cohorts, clients, and myself.  Chewing on the better part of a decade has provided me many embarrassing mistakes.  Humiliating mistakes.  Just horrendous mistakes.  From them, I can think of nine lessons that continue to rattle around in my head that have turned out to be solid gold -affording me the opportunities to make different mistakes.Here are 9 Things...Original Image: Alexandre Dulaunoy1) When you get the answer you want, stop talking.If you are asking for permission or validation of a plan, and you get it, it's really tempting to elaborate on your really thoughtful rationale because you are proud of the process.  Mistake!  Not only is it self-indulgent but it is full of risk, laying out specific opportunities around which your counterpart may change their mind.  Just accept your green light and move on confidently.  Seems pretty simple but this little angel whispers into my ear all the time.Original Image: Graeme Maclean2) That’s not “easy,” it’s “straightforward.”Never tell a client that a task would be easy, because that means free.  Few things ever deliver on the promise of easiness: inevitable surprises, testing, etc.  1) Your time, experience, and thinking are valuable and even though you didn't say 'free,' that's how it sounded, and 2) just watch that ""easy"" thing blow up into something more complex than you suspected.  If you want to vocalize an affirmative statement of effort, replace 'easy' with 'straightforward' in just about any case and you’ll be alllllright.Original Image: Randy Robertson3) Just go for it.If you work in a smallish company there is a nimbleness and probably more autonomy than you suspect.  Don’t necessarily invite or presume the comfort of bureaucratic permission.  There are certainly times of frustration when bureaucracy can feel inordinate, but consider how it is in a massive and maybe-soul-crushing entity and then re-calibrate.  If you have an idea or an initiative just go ahead and try it out, so long as it isn't preventing you from ""working"" (wink).  Caveats: If it involves spending money, well of course you need permission.  And the more it involves other people, the more you need to involve them (and the more likely some manager will care).  But, generally, go ahead do stuff you think is worthwhile -and get ready to live.Original Image: Wystan4) Don’t know? That’s ok.Customers, and I suppose managers, don’t expect you to know everything -but they definitely expect you to find out.  Whatever you do, don't give in to the urge to grope for a guess or nervously ramble (like I have done too often, and still do, probably).  Just own it.  Here is the four-step dance of this move:1) Admit you don’t know, 2) claim the homework, 3) ensure a timely response, and 4) get a verbal ‘ok’.A couple Cliff’s Notes examples:“You know what, I don’t know the answer to that off the top of my head, but let me ask the smart kids and I’ll get back to you, ok?”or...“That’s a good question, let us do some homework on our end, and we’ll come back with some options in our next meeting.  Does that sound alright?”Original Image: Travis Isaacs5) Let the customer talk.Never interrupt a customer.  Let them talk through their idea or problem.  They are the subject matter experts so there is a lot to learn -this is your chance.  Even if you strongly disagree on a suggestion for how a feature of tool is built (because you are more familiar with building them), you will be surprised at how often their line of thinking will come around once they work through it out loud.  And then it was their idea, and buy-in is secured.  And if that doesn't work, proceed to number 6...Original Image: John Smith6) Hear dictated solutions but listen for the root problem.Often a customer or coworker, who is speaking with you as a valuable resource, will dictate a solution -rather than describe their problem and work together on a solution.  That’s ok, just try to mentally translate all dictated solutions to a description of the problem, on the fly as you listen.  Repeat back to them what you understand the real issue to be or problem to solve (without rejecting their prescription), naturally steering into a more collaborative and productive conversation.  You were hired for creativity and problem-solving, not as a commodity (if that's not true, take stock).Original Image: Eran Finkle7) Know when to ice an email.Recognize when you are in an email fight and just cool off.  This can happen without your realizing it initially.  Email is fast and not spoken directly to a human face, and back-and-forths can grow terse.  So some level of anonymity, and the more callous retorts that that invites, is at play (how more likely are you to show anger to those on the other side of a car window than you are when standing in line next to them?).  If you are in a back and forth like that, make a phone call -stuff's going to go way better.  Failing that, shelve it for a couple hours and see if time gives you wisdom.  Relatedly, it is hard to emote in an email and something you confidently type in friendly sass can be intoned by a reader as really aggressive.  Good rule of thumb: Are you mad? If yes, your resultant email is likely to be counterproductive unless you’re really really careful.Original Image: Steve8) You do not own what you make.This is one of the biggest emotional traps an employee who makes can fall into (if you make for hire).  While your job may involve your creativity, ingenuity, time, and effort, the result is not yours.  You are trading those things for payment (financial, and intrinsic satisfaction).  While you may be the one creating something, you are only a steward of it.  Additionally, your work, however autonomous feeling, comes from an ecosystem of collaboration, tasks, customer access, and a creative environment provided by your employer.  The most angst-ridden situations in a software company can come from the easily misguided notion that something is yours, resulting in: a reluctance to share information and responsibility, feelings of betrayal when the project is reassigned, and heartache if the project is cancelled.Original Image: Kenny Louie9) Your job is only a part of who you are.While we spend maybe most of our waking time here at our jobs, and we invest our love into what we do and with whom we work, and hopefully take significant reward from our contributions, we are not our jobs.  It’s a great reward to love what you do, but we aren't our title.  Be careful not to over-allocate how you make a living into your sense of who you are.  This is a tough one, but balance and diversification can avoid some painful shifts and unhealthy expectations.  It especially helps you live in the moment outside of the office and with those you love, rather than caught up in distractions.Anyway, that's that.  Nine things.Tweet Follow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mWw069-4cAI/U20tpzA2SoI/AAAAAAAADG8/SZjR0We5sOE/s1600/GetAnswerYouWant.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 1})|>>"
"|>>How to Demo an App in Six Steps|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2014/04/how-to-demo-app-in-six-steps.html|>>","|>>Being asked to demonstrate an app or website, or whatever it might be, can be pretty unnerving.  Usually it's something you worked on, you care about it, and you have a galaxy of insights into each item and feature -and that microscopic familiarity can be the biggest problem when it comes to live or web meeting demonstrations.It's so tempting to blast into the minutia or say what this-or-that doesn't do.  Just imagine you are the audience and ask yourself what the important chunks are -the plan -a bullet list of nuggets. Then narrate out loud every movement you make and why, and take your hand off that mouse any second you aren't following that plan.Meow Wars by Kevin Dooley / FlickrSo here's a six-step cheat sheet for breezing through a demo...Opening HousekeepingThank the viewers for watching/attending (even if they are regulars).  If they are co-workers, a simple ""thanks everybody"" is fine.  If they are customers (or would-be customers) maybe turn up the formal a bit, like, ""thanks (person who introduced you) and thanks everybody for making it.""Introduce yourself, and give a less-than-one-sentence description of your role, even if you were introduced in the setup/hand-off.  They already forgot that; only now are they ready to jot your name down.“Can everybody see my screen?  Is everybody seeing the (whatever)?”  This is the first hurdle.  Make sure they are seeing what you are seeing, otherwise, you know, what's the point?  And definitely provide a head’s-up to your viewers about the inevitable web-meeting lag, if applicable.Invite them to interrupt you at any time with questions.  This is all about them.  ""Of course feel free to jump in anytime if you have a question; please interrupt.""Overview Statement of PurposeProvide a statement of context for the viewers.  Remind them why they are watching you demo.  Don’t dive into the guts (and don’t 'bury the lead').  If this were a newspaper article, what would the headline be?  Some examples, depending on what sort of demo it is:A feature pitch: ""So wouldn't it be nice to be able to quickly and easily roll up your manufacturing data by whatever geographic region you like? Here's how.""An iterative walk-through of an agile project: ""We've been heads-down this week on our latest set of tasks and we've made some exciting progress.""An overview demonstration of a product: ""Really, what VCC does, is give you a single picture of the people and places that you care about in the context of events that pose a risk to them so that you can get the jump on threats.""Tell them what you are about to show themIf it is an iterative demonstration of progress to a customer, like in an agile project, verbally list out the functionality that has been worked on before you demonstrate it.  It sounds crazily mundane, but it will give their expectations structure and prime them for an orderly demo.If it’s the first time someone has seen the content, start painfully generically.  If I’m demoing VF to a first-timer I will make a statement about the importance of visualization to IDV, then note the three layout zones (map, timeline, list) say why those dimensions are important to us.Always go general to specific.  For example, I'd first introduce the toolbox (where it is, what it is, what lives there), then the specific tool within -rather than getting to the tool as quickly as possible.Show themSlow movements and self-narration.Each click has cost, be click-stingy.  Viewers want to understand and follow along; don’t inadvertently mislead them with nervous clicking and unrelated mouse movements.Move slowly and deliberately.  Take your hand off the mouse when not actively demonstrating an action.Narrate your movements aloud, describing where your attention is moving to, the UI parts involved in the action, each action you take as you take it, and the result.Speak slowly.  Pause from time to time to see if someone is trying to chime in (conference calls pretty much mute everybody when you are talking -so give them windows to interrupt).Move from demo topics very deliberately.Introduce each topic before you demo it.  Always say what the feature is and why it exists.  If it is an enhancement to something they've seen previously, describe the difference.Close each topic by asking viewers if they have any questions about what they just saw, “before we move on.”If viewers interrupt with questions:Sometimes they ask a question related to the item you are currently demonstrating, to get more context.  Thank them for the question –it is an opportunity to clarify and proof that they are engaged –then answer it. ""Ah, that's actually a really good question, thanks for bringing that up.""Sometimes they ask questions that diverge from the current topic.  If it is a convenient segue over into that topic, thank them and go with it (but first ask if they are satisfied with the topic you are leaving).  ""Ok, sure, no problem.  Quickly, before we move in that direction, is everybody satisfied with the (feature you are now leaving)?""If answering the question does not require demonstration, answer it verbally and don’t touch that mouse.Tell them what you just showed themWhen the demo is complete, re-state the items you just walked through in the demo (to fully embed those memories).  This sounds really redundant because it is -but don't worry it's good redundant!“Ok, so you just saw improvements to the Excel Export functionality, the new color-categorization of buildings by business unit, and the new formatting of the buildings’ details panel.”Read out loud any list of homework items you may have collected during the demo.  Some people say “action items” but I think “homework” is more personable.“I have on my list of homework items the misspelled button in the export dialog, an answer to the question about census data, and ideas for optimizing the large number of employee locations in the United States.  Does that sound right?”Closing HousekeepingCheck for any follow-up or final questions.“Does anybody have any questions about what you just saw?” Oftentimes this will invite a segue and the audience might jump over to questions of cost or timing to the Project Manager or Sales Rep (if they are in the meeting) and your demo is effectively done.  Good job!  If not…Hand-off back to the Project Manager or the Sales Rep (if a hand-off is applicable) and thank them for their time.  If it is just you, thank the audience for their time.“Well thanks for taking the time to check this out.  If any questions come up in the meantime, of course feel free to reach out .  I’ll kick it back over to (PM or Sales Rep).”Next steps and/or closure.  Generally, a PM or Sales Rep will the handle next-steps discussion, but it could be you. Either way, make sure that you and the audience is clear on whose court the ball is now in.  Sometimes it takes the form of people sorting the next meeting time -but at that point the demo demo is definitely done and you can lean back and bathe in that feeling.  If it is just you demonstrating in the form of a pitch, you might talk about opportunities for improvement but pretty much wrap it up at this point.  Woop woop, time to exhale!Anyway, those are six steps to consider if you have a demo bearing down on you.  Now go rock it.Relatedly, I've taken much comfort and utility from the excellent advice of Matt Haughey on public speaking.  He does know where all the bananas are.  So if you are all, ""I don't do demos, I talk at conferences"" then head over to his tremendous article, but first get ready to live.-JohnFollow @JohnNelsonIDVTweet|>>","|>>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ss2l3cU-4Yo/U0_fiZ2zUfI/AAAAAAAADGo/JUJJ2vXwJK8/s1600/MeowWars.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'visualization': 1, 'data': 1})|>>"

Sure sure, all that.  But it just sounds fun, right?  I wondered what the new six states would look like among a cast of 55 and also how they might have voted in the impossible time-bending scenario of future-states performing in a past election.  So here is my abomination, which is equal parts 'oh, that's good to know' and 'this is far too complex a topic to handle this simplistically':Three sources of data for this:The Six Californias Initiative, itself, to identify county memberships in the proposed states.US Census total counts of per-county resident population.Politico's 2012 county-level Presidential election counts.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDVFlickr Photostream|>>","|>>http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/13104147505_a63e4c3d4a_b.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 1})|>>"
"|>>Blind Spots, Blue Lights, and Campus Security|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2014/02/blind-spots-blue-lights-and-campus.html|>>","|>>One of the coolest parts of being a thesis adviser is watching the ingenuity and thoughtfulness around a really cool project, and a sharp student.Central Michigan University geography student Sam Lipscombhas been building an analysis model of perceived personal safety that considers terrain, obstructions, lighting, and emergency call boxes to provide pictures of blind-spot risk across a campus.  Thoughtful, practical, and important.The college campus is a fine example of a landscape that is both constantly evolving and stuffed with occupants whose personal well-being is at the heart of its purpose.  Other domains, like office parks, public spaces, and hospital campuses share similar considerations –but colleges are special.  Some of the things designers and security personnel ask themselves of their campus are...How can we accommodate our visitors while doing our best to ensure their safety?Where should we put lights for best effect?Where do we currently have troublesome areas?Where should we position Blue Lights (emergency call boxes with blue lights sprinkled around campus)?Where should security patrols be located?That sort of thing.These questions are inherently geographic.  But to some degree the notion of place is considered only inadvertently (and less desirably) as a pull-through of where utilities, easements, and landscaping are already conveniently situated.  That, and well-meaning hunches.  This path-dependent mode of planning can really miss out on some key insights made possible by intentional spatial thinking.Parking lots pose a substantial blind-spot risk.  Though generally well-lit, a crowded parking lot dramatically reduces a person's overall eye-level visibility.A campus-wide analysis of visibility, incorporating a local line-of sight rating for every pixel.  Brighter areas are more open while red areas mark potential blind spots.A general viewshed of the constellation of emergency call boxes (blue lights with emergency two-way communications).  Red areas can see no call boxes.  White areas can see at least one.Here is that emergency call box visibility layer weighted by how accessible a call box is, given distance, terrain, and obstructions.  Black areas can't see any call boxes; red areas can see a call box but it's less accessible (or nearby but blocked from view).  White areas show where call boxes are readily accessible.Here, Sam has defined areas that are candidates for enbrightening.  Here's the recommendation for parking lots.And recommendations for enhanced lighting of pedestrian areas.Applying spatial brains and tools provides a quantifiable component to an informed and proactive design strategy for the arrangement of things that impact a person’s safety.  Like lighting, emergency call boxes, fences, sidewalks, plantings, signage, patrols, safety education –pretty much everything.  Sam's doing thoughtful and useful work and I anticipate its eager adoption.  Find a recent draft of Sam's research here.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV Flickr|>>","|>>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5hg4fjvL1m8/UwZwrQPVDfI/AAAAAAAADGA/Bjg3L9gCF1o/s1600/NighttimeIllumination_tn.png|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"
"|>>A Meta Portrait of Earth's Surface|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2014/01/a-meta-portrait-of-earths-surface.html|>>","|>>The chart and data is certainly not new, but I find myself focusing on it in presentations and since it had previously been embedded in a graphic with ten other charts,  its meta coolness got diluted.  But I think about this map, like, alot, and I wanted to tell you why.  And why I call it a map.Non-geographic data that can't help but arrange itself into a pixelated portrait of our planet.  What it is: Months on the left, time on top, roll-ups of pedestrian risk in the cells. What it really is: an emergent picture of the Earth's silhouette.Geography Finds a WayThe data you see in this cell chart (or ""heatmap"", but since I'm a cartographer that term is sort-of taken) is non-geographic.  It shows the proportion of American traffic fatalities that involved pedestrians by time (left-to right is the time of day and night while the up-and-down splits up the months of the year).Do you notice how strongly the band of elevated pedestrian risk bows the way it does?  That's because it is especially dangerous to walk at twilight (sun in your face, difficult lighting for object perception, more people walking about, all that).  But twilight is relative depending on the season, so you see the arc of sunset pushing out through summer months and back in for the winter months.  All because we live on a round thing flying through space.  The nature of that roundness is unintentionally revealed in this data.An Echoed Silhouette of EarthAs we whiz around the sun, once a year, the tilt of our round Earth means that there is a lot of change in the amount and timing of sunlight each day (increasing as you move away from the poles) throughout each trip around.  Amazingly, or not so amazingly to the tougher nuts out there, is that the very roundness of Earth is echoed in the shape of the curve you see in this chart.  It's like what I would expect to see from a rough radio telescope signal of some distant planet, only it's our planet.  And the signal we see is an emergent reflection of our movements on its curved surface.These traffic events happened in the United States.  But the curve would be the same for other Northern Hemisphere places, and it would bend the other way for places in the Southern Hemisphere.Because we live on something that is dynamic, data of our lives often reveals the signal of that dynamic process -a roundabout meta image of Earth.  That's a map.Life and DeathTo lump data together and visualize it through different dimensions and isolate different rates can seem to dull the acuity of the very real tragedies that it represents.  While I know this is the data of death, the pixels that paint in this simple chart are sourced from pain and loss in aggregate volumes I can't comprehend.  However, one of the ironies of studying the data of death is that it is often almost perfectly correlated with the data of life and the distinction between the acts of living and the act of death dissolves.Then, I start down the path of trying to illustrate the thread of life through ups and downs in geography to paint another, maybe more direct, portrait of Earth, which is our vaporous time on it.  And so it goes, the nature of our home to spring up in unexpected places, revealed by proxy in the data we collect about ourselves, nudging us into more questions with the benefit of perspective.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AXya4-4sWto/UuaxtxqHxnI/AAAAAAAADEA/i5iTOPYPD9s/s1600/HorizonPedestrianRisk.png|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 9})|>>"

"|>>Fake Wooden Bathymetric Maps|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2014/01/fake-wooden-bathymetric-maps.html|>>","|>>Have you seen these 3D wooden bathymetric maps in coastal tourist shops?  My Dad, who lives in Mackinac City, loves them.  He taught oceanography for 40 years so I imagine there is a snug little place for them to fit neatly inside his heart.  Here's a picture of one that hangs on his wall:Dad's wooden bathymetry map of Lake Michigan.  He wonders what they would look like with a continuous color palate.Dad's QuestionBut he's often told me that he wished each depth layer would have a deeper-looking color, and I agreed.  Based on how they are made, that would be really difficult (expensive) so I told him I'd make fake digital ones and show him what it might look like if depth were tied to a range of colors.  Then, of course, I got carried away.The results look less like the laser cnc map, above, and more like they were milled out of a thick block of wood.  Which I like even better, actually. Bathymetry in Various Species Because my maps are virtual, I can easily swap out the wood species for a totally different look.  And if you admire woodgrain the way I do, then you might enjoy the variability of the aesthetic.  Different types of wood have different lightness and really varying contrast, both having their own trade-offs.Birdseye MapleBurled WalnutCherry HeartwoodMahoganyMarblewoodPoplarStraight-grained WalnutWhat are the Real Ones Like?Some of the hallmarks of these maps are their generalized contours (so cutting them out of wood is feasible), slightly imprecise cartography (it's a map cut out of wood, give them a break), and wood-burned labels.The real maps start out as a thin sheet of wood, laser-cut along bathymetric lines of equal depth.  Areas of ocean get stained aquamarine and land stays bare wood.  Cartographic labeling and titles get burned on with a hot letter press, like a brand.  Then they are pushed into a backing form that offsets their heights according to the depth layers.  Drop that into a frame and paper up the back so as not to reveal the magic.  Ship to nautically-inclined retail locations.How to Make These Fake OnesI decided to make my fake wooden maps show the Mid-Atlantic Ridge because the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is awesome.  Here are the steps:-Data.  I found the bathymetric source data at Natural Earth and projected it to a centered Winkel Tripel projection.  I exported each depth sequence as an individual image layer with a transparent background.  Because this data has much more precision that is realistic from a wood-cut, I included a rather thick outline stroke to give a smoothing effect to the edges.  I'm not too concerned over the cartographic oddities this outline creates (the island in coastal Brazil, for example) since the real woodcut maps are inherently generalized and I don't mind a bit of kitch.  But the source data is stellar, to be sure.-Clipping.  I used each of the depth layers as the clipping (or ""masking"") source for my stock woodgrain imagery, individually, in an image editing program.  I used Fireworks, but you could do it in Illustrator or Gimp, or Photoshop, whatevs.  I offset the grain pattern fill slightly for each layer to replicate the small depth change in the ""block"" of wood.  Then I added a beveling filter (AKA an inset shadow of white in the top-left and an inset shadow of black to the bottom-right) to give the effect of protruding elevation with an imaginary light-source in the upper left (which is right where a light-source should be, for some reason).-Text.  I used two types of text in the map.  The first is the simple branded wood-burn text for cartographic labels.  To do that I used black text with a dark brown glow filter to replicate the creeping of the scorched wood.For title text I replicate a wood inlay.  I do a black text with an inset bevel and slight Gaussian blur (to replicate the carved out wood channels) and on top of that I duplicate the text and give it a brighter wood species pattern fill with a bevel filter (to replicate the cut-out letters I crammed in to the cut channels).  Do yourself a favor and watch this demonstration of actual inlay lettering to really appreciate the ease of changing digital fonts, or if you just like typography in general.-Color.  Picking the right color palate was more involved than I thought (but, considering this was the whole reason for doing this, I didn't mind).  The goal is to make it look like the wood has been slightly stained at each depth, so I used a 20% color fill filter to each wood layer along the 8 color stops I ended up with.  Because of how much the underlying wood coloration affected the tinting, I worked through several iterations until I got something that didn't look like it went from green to purple.  It was a good reminder of the impact of underlying colors and textures for regular mapping.I think that's just about it.  Thanks for having a look!TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bZpAXRp4Ss8/Usr5pDgYmlI/AAAAAAAADB8/lUOKxNSzX9Q/s1600/20131222_092717.jpeg|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 3})|>>"
"|>>2013 Recap|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/12/2013-recap.html|>>","|>>A quick scan of my 2013 projects here shows three distinct types of posts.  The most interesting and fun is the hey I just made this thing sort of post.  Followed by the try this out posts.  And lastly the more day to day housekeeping of this and that posts.Thanks for the fun conversations, project ideas, and support all year long.  2013 was both difficult and thrilling and certainly packed with lessons which I didn't necessarily want (but those turn out to be the truest sort).  Here's a 2013 rundown of this blog:ProjectsDrunk Driving in American CitiesA follow-up to late 2012's traffic fatality series, folks morbidly(?) wondered how their city's drunk driving stats stacked up in a more ranked sense.  Well you got it!  This is a sort-of bump chart of the biggest US cities, with some interesting city signatures, for sure.Seattle People DotsA pile of dot maps illustrating Seattle area commuters.  You know, that dot-mapping thing where each person is a tiny speck tumbling about in a sea of other tiny specks.  Hang on, Dostoyevsky just called, I have to take this.Biking & Walking to WorkMore commute dots.  This time they show the ""top"" bike-friendly cities and differentiate between biking & walking vs everything else.  I drive to work, but if I lived close enough, I like to think that I'd bike there in the two months a year that it is feasible.Map MathThe process of making data maps is way more fun than looking at them.  Here's a behind-the scenes look at some raw data sets and how they get crammed together into ratios (and ratios of ratios).  It's so meta.  I earned a fair bit of scorn for my garish color ramp.  I defended it at the time, but the benefit of hindsight has won me over to the side of my critics.Sandy and the Buildings of NYCThe age old story of floods and buildings.  Buildings and floods.  This was a take at seeing one data set (actual and predicted flood zones) cookie cut by another (building footprints).Color Theory Through the Google-ifierOrange makes you hungry.  Yellow bedrooms are associated with schizophrenia.  I hear stuff like that a lot.  So I asked Google Image search what different terms looked like and sampled them down to their average color.Tornado Travel MapBig shocker, tornadoes tend to move to the northeast.  But here is a picture that takes a step at illustrating just how overwhelming that overall trend is.  This was my first chart is star, maps are second fiddle layout and I like it.Language and ColorA lot like that color-theory-googlifier thing above, but this time I wanted to see how connections of colors with ideas vary across different cultures.  Listen up, grad students, there is a solid thesis in there (for anyone better at math and psychology and anthropology than me -which is everybody).A Breathing EarthThis wamma-jamma turned out to be three times more popular than all other posts this year, combined.  I got all dopy and sentimental about it, but so did other folks, too, so shut up just shuuut up!  I am NOT crying, YOU'RE crying!Football Game-Day Traffic FatalitiesIn addition to fearing I'd be sued for libel, of all the projects this year this one stole the most sleep because of my struggle to describe it.  Pro tip: any time you have to paraphrase statements of statistical significance in a map, maaaaybe it's time to re-think things.The Dispersion of Life and Gender2013 had me asking all sorts of questions to myself.  This map series was a natural result of paying extra attention to the arc of birth, ambition, love, and death.  Hey, P.S. we found out recently we're having a baby due in June and I'm really excited to meet him/her.United Nations of BitcoinSort of a map of the international adoption of Bitcoins, but really just a map of operating system popularity by country.  If I had this to do again, it would be much different.  It's pretty lame, actually -but I am pleased with the aesthetic.How-ToSevere Satellite BasemapsI have a love-hate with satellite imagery used as basemaps (mostly love, but local news uses it so poorly).  But, when I do use them I like to crank up the drama to eleven using a couple tricks.  Plus I've gotten pretty good at rationalizing why this is the way to go.Mercator Globe HackNine pennies, some yarn, and a globe my wife got me at Salvation Army are the props employed to illustrate Mercator's warping of size and direction.Hex MappingNecessity of the mother of invention.  When you don't have a tool that does what you need, maybe try a bunch of tools and sneaky uses of them.  The things I go through for my lack of programming capabilities.Dasymetric Dot Density and the Uncanny ValleyFrankenstein's monster of a blog post.  Lots going on in this one, including my tendency to associate everything with the uncanny valley.  The takeaway: if you have any use for country shapes clipped down to populated areas, then have at this shapefile.Unrequested Map Tips parts One and TwoWhenever I find myself writing advice, I ratchet up the self-deprecation to counteract sounding like a know-it-all crank.  But in the end I probably just sound like a self-deprecated know-it-all crank.  Wait, I just did it again!  Anyway, there are some good bits in there for cartographers, or those who enjoy reading about the human condition by way of cartographic techniques.Silly Geographic PrecisionSure, it's a pull-through of sloppy database configuration, but exceedingly long coordinates are misleading and bloaty.  Best to match precision with their recording accuracy.  The gist: six decimal places is all you need -the rest ranges from dumb to pure evil.Paper Globe TemplateThe one where I copy my wife's Pinterest-inspired Christmas ornament project and try to make a globe-like thing out of it.  Resulting globe-things are for decorative purposes only and I will not be held responsible for gross navigational errors, or the grievous loss of comfort and property, experienced as a result of their misuse.UpdatesFreaky FridayEvery now and again we have a hack day.  These were the projects.  The fat flow of idea to demonstration, and the clever and creative folks I get to work with here are two of my very favorite aspects of IDV.Tribute to a GeographerI wrote this way too soon after losing my Mom, but I was proud of her and writing to you about it seemed appropriate.  What's the point in writing anything if it's without sincerity?  Grief is weird, and I learned that I tend to do it privately -except for when I write, which helped give shape to the pain.  Many thanks to those who reached out with their comfort.WelcomeThis summer Josh Stevens joined us as Visiting Cartographer.  He was a valuable collaborator on several spatial projects and was a lot of fun to have around.  Unfortunately, a lot of product work sprung up at that time so I didn't get to spend as much time with him as I'd have liked.  Brilliant guy.Best American InfographicsIt's a treat to be on a scouting team with such talented folks and a thrill to see the tornado tracks map conjured in print.  The other day I was in the bookstore and I showed the book to my littles.  It was a proud moment for a dad, showing off a little to the only ones it matters showing off to.Adventures in MappingThe slide-share of a lecture to a class of informatics students at UC Davis.  I have found that I never really understand something so well as when I have to explain it to somebody else.  Teaching is reciprocal.Amazing Maps from 1880Whenever I need a real kick in the gut, I browse historical data mapping archives to realize that it's all been done before -collected via horseback, aggregated by hand, etched on copper plates, and bound individually in leather.  And here I am whining that I have to define hex values for color gradients.Anyway, be thankful for your 2013 and do well in 2014.  All the best,John|>>","|>>none|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 4})|>>"

Washington state?  Deadly with pneumonia!  Utah is the place for abdominal distress.  Half of New Mexico deaths were attributed to heart conditions.  The Consumption?  Pretty much everywhere.  Everybody dies.  And while that inevitability is fresh in my mind, seeing a picture of the spatially varying causes tells me that there is more than environmental determinism at work, but evidence that leads to better care and precaution.The particular geographies of economics.  Not far removed from emancipation, the South, former slave-holding domain of cotton plantations, was still the overwhelming agricultural zone of the nation.  The fertile plains of the Midwest had yet to be fully tilled under into the corn belt and bread basket of a hemisphere.  As the railroads expanded west, zipping crops and livestock east became more logistically feasible.In the late 1800s the United States were a magnet for Europeans looking for opportunity and room to spread their legs.  Shortly after this map was made, my Norwegian ancestors landed in, not surprisingly, Chicago.  More than 20% of Ireland's population left their homeland in the preceding decades, many of them to the young United States, particularly Massachusetts, fleeing famine when the mono-culture of the potato collapsed, among other things.Anyway, it is works like this that make me feel a combination of exhilaration and and anxiety.  On one hand, it is an inspiring example of thoughtful and artistic work by a team that is not just at the top of their craft, but wielding an expertise that makes cartographers 130 years into the future envious.  On the other hand, I am taken aback at the herculean feat of data wrangling at a time when these locations were distant and dangerous and remote by weeks.  I don't hold a strong confidence that I would be able to replicate their work in its own right even with the massive technological and communications advantages that I enjoy. But, of course, it's not about the tools but rather the care taken in communicating a story. Ironically, I look at visual performances like this and suspect that it is in part precisely because our ability now to churn out products so quickly and effortlessly that the results often do not compare to those that required an inordinately greater investment and therefore commanded a sense of magnitude in the proceeding that has few analogs today.  But I recognize the debate between quantity and quality is largely a false one, as there are data artists today who are no less thoughtful in their approach.  And while the overall volume of visual work has exploded, I see this as evidence of a broad pool of new and interested participants who have every opportunity to improve and thrive.Though as for this, I say well done, Fletcher, Hewes, Gannett, and team.  You are still wowing, generations out.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SEgcl5LekGo/Uo5ZKS4_n7I/AAAAAAAAC_s/9VhNAEoBW68/s320/Cover.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 3})|>>"
"|>>Silly Geographic Precision|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/11/silly-geographic-precision.html|>>","|>>I tread water in oceans of latitude longitude coordinates.  Every vector data set I encounter is big fat sets of latitude (up-downiness) and longitude (left-rightiness) bits of info which combine (the ""co"" in coordinates) to pinpoint a spot on the surface of the Earth (and those combine to trace lines or areas).  The more precise the coordinate's numbers, the finer the pinpointing.  But sometimes I see data (usually the results of address geocoding) with a ridiculous number of digits past the decimal place, implying waaaaay too specific a location.  For example, today I saw the sample below as the result of an address geocode.  I'll use a large courier font to connote just how epic this is...47.640120461583138-122.12971039116383That's a tight geocoding.  Not only does the level of precision pinpoint a building, it pinpoints a specific atom in the building.Here's a breakout of coordinate precision by the actual cartographic scale they purport: Decimal Places  Actual Distance Say What?  6 10 centimeters Your footprint, if you were standing on the toes of one foot.  7 1.0 centimeter A watermelon seed.  8 1.0 millimeter The width of paperclip wire.  9 0.1 millimeter The width of a strand of hair.  10 10 microns A speck of pollen.  11 1.0 micron A piece of cigarette smoke.  12 0.1 micron You're doing virus-level mapping at this point.  13 10 nanometers Does it matter how big this is?  14 1.0 nanometer Your fingernail grows about this far in one second.  15 0.1 nanometer An atom. An atom! What are you mapping? As a reference, six decimal places of precision is generally plenty-good-enough territory for cartography.  Unless you are collecting the cornerstone base survey coordinate for a mechanical engineer, let's call this good.Not all Longitudes are the SameA degree of Latitude is about 68.71 miles, and that's pretty* consistent as you go north or south (when you climb up or down the ladder of latitude, each rung is the same distance).  A degree of Longitude is widest at the equator (about 69.17 miles) but gets narrower and narrower until they all pinch together right down to nothing at the the poles.  The examples above are pretty much best case examples when it comes to Longitude; they get even sillier when you move away from the equator.A Fine MeshLatitude and Longitude lines are the tics of an imaginary mesh that covers the world -like pixels on a screen.  Every time you add a number to the right of each decimal in a Lat Long coordinate, you subdivide the mesh of the Earth by ten each way (bumping your resolution 100 times finer each step).  Things get crazy in a hurry and it's common to encounter data with not just meaningless, but deceivingly precise coordinates.  Just because something is precise, that doesn't mean it's accurate.P.S. I read a really good book by Dava Sobel a while back on the surprisingly epic history of Longitude.  It's called Longitude.  If you are nerdy enough to have read down this far then it's a safe bet you'll enjoy it.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>none|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 3})|>>"
"|>>20 Unrequested Map Tips part 2|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/11/20-unrequested-map-tips-part-2.html|>>","|>>...continued from 20 Unrequested Map Tips part 1Unfortunately, my niece Kadence's definition of maps is, frequently, correct.  Here are some tips to avoid landing squarely within this sentiment.Alright, you didn't ask for it, and here they are!  The final ten unrequested map tips.  As with the previous ten, I'll use examples from my stuff because it's easy to ask my permission (and slightly less because of rampant megalomania).  Also, to attach credibility, please read the following with the inner-monologue voice of  Morgan Freeman...#11: Thinking choropleth for count data? Maybe try dot density. It self-normalizes for area, is emotionally resonant, and looks cooler.They are speckly little wonders.  They dispense with the whole normalize-by-area problem, sure, but they also detour you right past that abstract business of data range classification and tying those ranges to a color key (and the good old legend, map, legend, map workflow as working memory constantly vaporizes).A single dot representing a single thing is a big fat affordance of interpretation and a smooth on-ramp to an natural cognitive association of your data with volume and dispersion.  Plus it's easier to personalize, encouraging emotional uptake.Sure, while dot density randomly disperses dots inside the polygons, if the polygons are small and numerous enough then the bummer of randomness is marginalized.  Also, there are dark tricks for constraining your dots into more realistic areas (no dots in vacant places).Dot density isn't always the right way to go, but if you want to illustrate general dispersion and volume (especially if you have a couple of categories to highlight) it's worth a go.  Some inspiring characters in this space are Kirk Goldsberry, Andy Woodruff, and Brandon Martin-Anderson.Can I actually count up all the commuters?  No, but who cares.  I get a good sense of the dispersion of commuters though, plus, bonus, what method they use to commute.  Alternatively, this would have required four separate choropleth rate maps to get the same point across, and even then I'd have huge low-population areas gobbling up most of my visual plain.  From People Dots: Seattle Area Commuting.When mapping individual human counts, nothing resonates emotionally quite like a one-to-one dot density approach.  From Gender Flow in NY.  Those are people, man!#12: Be intentional about aesthetics. Good design buys a second, closer, look.This one's harder to write about because it's more subjective (plus any attempt to elaborate makes me feel like a pretentious know-it-all).  But there are definitely good lookin maps and ugly maps.  And all things being equal, the good lookin map is going to visit a much broader audience.  Maps are portraits of a phenomenon so other humans will look at it and appreciate the message.  That's it.In my experience, the first time that became obvious to me was with the tornado tracks map.  This map went mainstream because people thought it was pretty.  Then they started noticing things and asking questions.  When people stop and look because something is cool, the thing to note is that they stopped and looked.  When something you design is visually striking, you stuff it with the currency that buys thoughtful attention.The greatest step you can take towards honoring the aesthetics of your map is to avoid defaults (#3).  Also, I like this discussion at Stack Exchange -lots of variability (and more detail than an unrequested tip).I feel like a real tool actually citing an example for this, but it was a solid lesson for me in the importance of aesthetics in map design and its capacity to infiltrate a wide audience.  Geographic data has potential energy like no other form -appealing design converts that into kinetic energy. From Tornado Tracks.#13: Sometimes maps are a terrible way of presenting a geographic phenomenon. Don’t carto so quickly.Because you are a cartographer, of course you'll be inclined to map geographic data geographically.  But some of the inherent properties of geography make the strict spatial representation of a phenomenon an inefficient and ineffective means of presenting it.  It's not heresy to present it another way and I hope you never feel bound by spatial in the presentation tier.I first saw this data rendered as a set of many many maps that you could pick to see one at a time (one world map for every historic Olympic games).  Effective comparison between games was tough.  Also, the geographic size of countries varies dramatically (and distracted from the message) and many of them I couldn't see or even tell which were which.  The data was compact and awesome, but divested into a string of maps wasn't doing it justice.In one cell chart, the mutual dimensions of countries, eras, and rates, increases findability, and traces the lifelines of whole nations at a glance.  Plus it happened to look like a DNA stain, which was serendipitous.  P.S. This is a screenshot of Excel.  From Olympic Medal Counts In Perspective.While the lion's share of the work was heavy geoprocessing across several spatial data sets, the result above is a distilled set of lists.  Just because something is hard to do doesn't mean it should look like it was hard to do.  The opposite, really.  The relative geographic sizes, shapes, and locations of these cities made their literal mapping impractical and damaging to the message.  From Drunk Driving in American Cities.Sparklines provide a data-dense and intuitive representation of 100 years of the apportionment balancing act for every state.  From Visualizing Apportionment.#14: Using Mercator if you don’t have to, or Equirectangular for...anything? Use something else, anything else!Another plea to avoid defaults!  Equirectangular is the convenient de-facto of GIS data distribution (pretty much what you get if you never consider projection in your process).  Once you are looking at that data, Equirectangular's job is done.  A hallmark of the bush leagues, it should under no circumstances survive into map production (except maybe if you are tracking satellites, but really, are you tracking satellites?).Mercator is, admittedly, a fair tradeoff if you are making a web map.  Currently there isn't a ton you can do about that.  But if you are making a static map from scratch and you aren't leaning on a tiled service for your basemap then why would you use it?  Picking a projection that illustrates your phenomenon well, or in a novel perspective, can be the most mind-blowing part of cartography.While a little disorienting at first (that's fine, there is evidence that struggle promotes memory retention), the polar projection is my favorite part of this map.  It reveals the nestedly cyclic nature of hurricanes and invokes a fun fractal-like consideration of the universe.  From Hurricanes Since 1851.{Are you still reading this with the inner-monologue of Morgan Freeman?  I was serious about that.}#15: Don’t box out your legend or supporting charts. They should be integrated, not quarantined.I used to be the carto-segregation king.  Everything got a box!  In time, and with the advice of Amy Lobben, I began dispensing with the neatline and integrating visual elements.  There is research that shows a more integrated placement of data-conveyance elements (words, charts, maps, images...) facilitates a faster and firmer understanding of the phenomenon.  Also, I've an ally in Tufte in this regard so take it up with him if you want to stick all your illustrations in a crappy appendix!Daniel Huffman (once more) provides detail and clarity in the plight against neatlines.Nobody puts Baby in the corner.  Integrate map, notes, charts, graphics, legend, whatevz (also, check out how that chart is also a legend! Boom, #4!).From Data Americana.Conversely, the understanding that proximity implies a relationship can be leveraged to team elements up for cross-comparison within a single graphic.  From Telling the Truth and Mapping the Truth.#15: Do you need that basemap? Can it be simplified? Sometimes enough data can provide its own geographic context.Mostly what I mean is, does your data really need to have that Google Maps background?  Google Maps is a great wayfinding and placefinding utility, but not so much for the background of a data map.  Often there is much more noise than signal in a consumer-oriented basemap, altering and sometimes damaging the effective presentation of your phenomenon.  Try out some alternate (simpler) tile sources if you are making a web map.  And if you are making a static map, try pushing back your basemap prominence either a lot or into oblivion.If your data is dense enough, it may well provide enough context to support itself.  A basemap is only there to provide a geographic reference, and should not be an almanac of all things spatial (maybe it doesn't need all those roads, railroads, golf courses, rivers...).Sometimes even a single data source, like building footprints, is so data-dense that its cookie-cut negative space provides the context for the phenomenon.  From Sandy and the Buildings of NYC.The phenomenon is the focus.  Faint major arterial roads and state borders are enough to provide a geographic orientation.  From A National Portrait of Drunk Driving.#16: Show that same mapped data in companion charts. More visual dimensions for discovery.Companion charts don't have to be different data.  If you can present some quality of that geographic data in one or more other visual constructs, than a fuller picture of the phenomenon is presented.  They all begin to support and illuminate eachother.  An ecosystem of goodness.Showing the exact same data in many dimensions illuminates trends and strengthens the value of each.From Major Fires Since 2001. #17 Stuck with stoplight colors? Pick similar hues that are still cool for the color-deficient. I blow this all the time.Sometimes the effective cultural conventions of color override what might be a more efficient means of assigning color.  Bring on the stoplight metaphor.  If you are mapping poor, good, best or slow, medium, and fast, then you will be forsaking an awful lot of reader pre-programming if you don't use good old green yellow and red.  But that doesn't mean you have to use the more troublesome flavors of those hues, pushing green one way and red another way makes them far more discernible to the color-deficient.Red-green vision deficiency is just prevalent enough that you can't ignore it with notions of practicality and just rare enough that the use of troublesome color combinations is still common.I botch this all the time, but I increasingly take efforts to run graphics through color-deficiency simulators and tweak hues so that the colors are discernible.Simulators are great empathy resources.  You can tweak your hues to be more palatable (wink) to the color-deficient.  From Charting for Understanding.#18: Try de-saturating that satellite background. Like, a lot.Always maintain focus of message.  Only use a satellite background if that satellite imagery is providing more benefit-through-context than deficit-through-complexity (#15).  If your mapped phenomenon sits atop a satellite basmap, mute the saturation of the imagery so it does not fight with or diminish the star of the show.  Also it just looks really cool (#12).  When I reduce the colors of satellite background imagery I generally push it back to about 20% of its original saturation.  Fully black-and-white is alright, but there is a sort of gravitas, and plenty of valuable surface context, when the imagery retains some of its hue.Desaturated satellite imagery is easier on the eyes, feels more profound, and is a more effective basemap.From Severe Satellite Basemaps.  Source satellite imagery via NASA Visible Earth.#19: Put unfamiliar units into meaningful context, or tangible comparisons. Nobody really understands what a Megawatt is.If you can translate an unfamiliar or intangible unit into something readers can picture or feel, then the map is more relateable and the nature of the phenomenon is more likely to speak to the reader (communication is the only reason there has ever been to make a map).  However, if you are mapping electrical field specifications for aerospace specialists and electrical engineers, definitely do not convert technical units into something cute (engineers were bred to reject metaphor and had their cute receptors surgically removed in college).Not that I totally relate to units of nuclear power plants either, but parsing Megawatts into something remotely tangible provides perspective and clarity of message.  From Major Fires Flip-Book.#20: Did you make a pretty cool map? Pretty AND cool? Put it on the web and get ready to live! People love maps!When you suspect you'll be releasing something into the wild, that map will dominate one you know will have no audience.  I assure you that sharing your work will sharpen its quality.  Also, people eat maps up, and the world needs more excellent examples of them -be ready for all sorts of insights and questions from people who are experts in all sorts of things and people who are simply curious.  You may be surprised to learn that there is an eager market for your product and you have little right to keep it to yourself.Edward Appleby gets it.You might find, as I have, that making maps and flinging them out into the world is intensely rewarding and to not participate in the adventure of creation when you suspect you've got what it takes is a shame.  If making maps or making whatever is something inside you that you just enjoy, chances are you'll get reasonably good at it and that satisfaction will permeate you and those that encounter your work.If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.Tweet  Follow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EkZiN7YbX3E/Unec1BZTPKI/AAAAAAAAC_M/ZBWMCKraGnQ/s320/KadenceMap.jpg|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 17})|>>"
"|>>20 Unrequested Map Tips part 1|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/10/20-unrequested-map-tips-part-1.html|>>","|>>Golly I like maps.  I make them and I look at them and I imagine them in my head when I look at spreadsheets.  Some are better than others, and after a while I've noticed some things that tend to work and plenty of things that don't.  I'll tend to use examples of my own stuff because it's easy to ask my permission (not because I know everything and always get it right).  Here are some map-making tips you did not ask for...#1: Aggregate reluctantly.Rolling up data into bigger chunks removes information.  When you do that geographically, you inherently degrade the resolution of the data and maybe mislead (on the flip-side you get a tidy summary of a phenomenon...that may or may not be true).  But almost certainly you make it look less-cool.  People are shockingly good at detecting patterns from noise (sometimes too good).  Maybe it's a good call to aggregate your map data into bigger units and that's the way to go, but don't just do it as a knee-jerk reaction to a big data set.  I mapped on mental cruise-control in that way for a long tome and in hindsight missed out on lots of cool opportunities.Aggregation inherently diminishes nuance.Which map will give Bear a more realistic sense of the political landscape of his fellow citizens? From Election 2012.#2: Makers need to make. Give them the chance or they'll move on.If you are a cartographer, or hire cartographers, the ones that are any good are the ones that have maps in them that are going to come out one way or another.  If a maker doesn't have a creative outlet for their own ideas, they will feel a diminished sense of purpose as the fine abrasion of solving other people's problems wears down the sharpness of their intrinsic satisfaction.Seeking Truth is one of the three pillars of motivation in the human endeavor, according to the compact framework of Plato (by way of Jeffrey Wagner).A solid portion of official time spent mapping what you feel like will make a you as a cartographer more intrinsically motivated, more curious about and practiced in alternative methods, more tuned-in to the community, and more invested in the rest of the work you do.  You'll be better.  Or you'll find yourself mysteriously interested in other opportunities.I don't have a graphic for this one.#3: Defaults are evil! Stay away from the defaults!You are not among the legion of mappers that are happy to crank out a GIS-ville map where not a single default was considered and changed.  But if you were...Default whats?  Default projection (Equirectangular, see #14), default colors, default range classification (whatever the GIS threw at you -probably ""natural breaks""), default range labels (truncated attribute names with underscores) default auto-layouts full of huge north arrows, overzealous neatlines, and scalebars that label in meaningless units and precision.Defaults are nice because they let us see our stuff right away without manually setting 19 preferences before any data is rendered.  But that's it.  Change each and every one, because you thought about them.  I've made plenty of ugly maps in my life, and they were usually the result of my lazy acceptance of the default assembly line.Daniel Huffman did a great job of helpfully describing why certain maps fail, over at Cartastrphe.  I recognize lots of default-ridden examples in there.I made this unfairly poor map, using the magic of defaults.He hates these cans! Stay away from the cans! In this illustration...the cans are defaults.  And I'm Navin.#4: Can your legend double as a supporting chart? That liability is now an asset.Legends are like collateral damage.  An unfortunate reality of getting a job done.  They only exist because the map is too hard to decipher on its own and needs a de-coder tool, and often, that's just the way it is.  But if you can add a dimension of data into the legend then it becomes a chart and pulls its own weight.  You can think of this in reverse, too.  If your map has a companion chart (which is awesome), use the same colors, for example, as the map and in that way they support and explain each other (then just scrap that dead weight legend).In this case, the chart steals the show while also serving to legend the maps.  From Tornado Travel Map.Acts of piracy color-coded to time makes a helpful chart and removes the need for a dedicated legend. From the Piracy Top 5.#5: Does your phenomenon care about political boundaries? Maybe not.Political units are the most over-used geometry in mapping.  They are really convenient because you can download them anywhere and the lion's share of geographic data is already aggregated into those areas.  And that's fine.  But remember that you aren't mapping data, you are mapping a phenomenon.  And if your phenomenon couldn't care less about counties, states, and countries (pretty much anything that doesn't involve humans) then neither should you.BUT even if your phenomenon doesn't care about political boundaries, adding them in as a faint reference will provide geographic context.A tornado doesn't care what state it passes through.  But adding a minimal state reference helps readers orient themselves and identify familiar places (""What's up with the tornado-free zone around West Virginia?""). From Tornado Tracks.#6: Only aggregate to political boundaries if you want to (should) pin the phenomenon to politics.This is pretty similar to #6, but its overuse bears some repeating.  What should you stuff into political polygons?  Anything that you want to associate with a politician or a cultural identity.  This includes the bulk of social scienc-y data, like population demographics, economic measures, and cultural characteristics and perceptions.  Even if mapping to political areas is the way to go, consider something other than a boring old choropleth.  Mapping data to political shapes does not automatically mean you make a choropleth.Identifying specific counties with extremes in home vacancy rates is a natural fit for mapping with political areas. From Lights Out.Sometimes the desire to attach a cultural place (building footprints) with a natural phenomenon (hurricane flooding) is such that that you take efforts to cram a-political data into political zones (as a means of personalizing a phenomenon using relateable places). From Sandy and the Buildings of NYC.#7: To animate or to small-multiple?  Just make both.Seriously.  If you've made one then you've pretty much made the other.  Throw them both out there and let folks get insights via either one.  Do you get more out of cartoons or comics?  Here's a cartoon of the comic, and here's a comic of the cartoon.But, if you do animate, be wary of interpolated (guesses) transitions between stops (knowns).  Long smooth transitions damage change detection -which is why you are animating in the first place.  Readers will notice more change in a flip-book style animation than when there is a longer transition (short-term memory leaks between data A and data B); the ""pleasing"" transition inherently disguises differences.You have the materials for both if you have them for either.  Just release the both of them and hedge your carto bets.From Somali Pirate Years.#8: Were you asked to use a dozen colors to denote categories? Run, it’s a trap!This is one of those instances where you should hear what you are asked to do but listen for the actual problem to solve.  This is a really big issue and a huge (and valuable) skill to develop.  You were hired for your expertise, so don't be timid to respectfully propose preferred alternatives to a client.  But be ready to rationalize it.  I use this example because it seems to be the most common evidence in the map-making world of the gap between assuming the role of a technical resource (cog) vs. being a knowledge worker.  ""Make them different colors"" is easy to request but try to deliver an actual solution, rather than scratch off a task item (this is more easily said than done depending on the customer).Since you know that our visual system is increasingly terrible at differentiating beyond a handful of hues, it's ok to suggest strategies that are effective (and likely more aesthetically pleasing).Don't do this (sorry Guardian).#9: Did you make it? Put your name on it! Were you influenced by others? Hat tips all around!Always sign your work.  There is no better quality assurance measure than stamping your name to something.  If you are designing in autonomy it can be too easy to crank out sub-par work.  And on the flip side, you ought to be proud of the work you've done and it's right to attach ownership in this little way.  Earned esteem is another of the big three motivators.  Don't be ashamed by it, on balance.The cartographic community isn't huge, and like any ecosystem we're influenced and inspired by others.  That's terrific, and much of the fun of being among a group of familiar faces is the leapfrogging that might not happen in a professional vacuum.  Just be generous in the citations and hat tips you attach to your work.  If your map is an extrapolation of somebody else's map, say so -they'll probably be excited to see it.  If yours is an exercise in applying somebody else's aesthetics to some new data, say so -they'll likely be honored.  Plus, you'll increase your audience and maybe find yourself to be an exciting thread in your own professional network.Develop a citation layout that you like and try to be consistent with it.  If you have a writing domain like a map blog or Visual.ly, you can elaborate on the cast of influential characters there. From Election 2012.#10: Can you get away with encoding color right in your map's title and scrap the “legend”? Go for it.Sometimes the phenomenon you are mapping only needs a little bit of help to let the user know what they are seeing.  Especially when you are using a few colors to represent different categories.  If you can, try coloring the names of the categories right in the map's title and do away with the overly literal math equation (this = that).The largely-pictoral title of a commuting map intrinsically connects topic and color. From Biking & Walking to Work.The encoding of color to meaning in this title carries over to four separate types of illustrations throughout the graphic. From Game Day Fatalities.A map of gender dispersion in New York is legended directly in the title. From Gender Flow NYC.Rather than a legend that noted the dot-to-people ratio (1=1) and indicated color with little equations (this colored circle = this type of commuter) the use of color in the title removes unnecessary elements and provides smoother continuity from topic to graphic.

"|>>Dasymetric Dot Density and the Uncanny Valley|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/10/dasymetric-dot-density-and-uncanny.html|>>","|>>All of cartography is a lie.  And there are pros and cons that go along with lying more truthfully.  Dasymetric dot density mapping is one way of lying more truthfully.  Here's the lowdown...Dasymetric just means cookie-cutting the areas (like countries) for which you have data (like population) into more specific areas (NASA's zones of populated places) that do a better job of restricting those zones to where your data actually occurs.Hmmmm...One of the great things about dot density mapping is that it normalizes for area all by itself.  You don't have to do a ratio of population divided by square miles (a cognitive abstraction) and then key that up to a sequence of colors (another cognitive abstraction) like you would with a choropleth map.  But one of the sort-of drawbacks of dot density mapping is that the dots are randomly distributed within their areas -all you can control is how many dots.  And if the dots are representing any sort of human data (like bicyclists, demographics, votes, commuters, downloads, etc.) then you are assuredly sprinkling many of them around in places that are obviously unpopulated.  Sometimes that's ok, but sometimes it's pretty silly.  Dasymetric mapping means we pare back our areas to only those that are likely to contain the phenomenon of interest (which was collected at that lower resolution).Here's the Natural Earth cultural boundary file of countries.  It is a fantastic and generous resource, which I hope you check out.  It also has a field for estimated population, which I'll use as my example.The countries of the world, provided by Natural Earth.Inspired by Derek Watkins' fantastic squinty-eyed look at population densities (itself inspired by Wild Bill), I downloaded NASA's population density imagery and retained only the areas where they have estimated a population density of at least 5 people per square kilometer (seemed like a reasonable cut-off for ""populated place""), converted it to a vector polygon set and then clipped the Natural Earth countries by it.This is the result, in blue.  You can download this file for your own pursuits, here.The countries of the world, pared back to populated areas.  Download this shapefile.Before Dasymetric Clipping, and AfterHere's a dot density map of the world showing population per country (each dot represents 50,000 people).  By the way, I use population because it's convenient for illustration.  So the map below is ok, and I do get a sense of which countries have more turf than people -overall, but it is not all that characteristic of how distributed the people are where people actually are.Take Australia for instance.  The average Australian lives in a city perched along the coast.  And the fact that the rest of the continent is pretty much devoid of humans doesn't mean that they look around their neighborhood and see fewer people.  It's an imprecise look at population for countries with vast stretches of low or unpopulated areas (i.e. pretty much everywhere except Europe).  Alaska sucks up many of the dots that really ought to go into the lower 48.  Other obvious examples of people dots happily dispersed in vast lonely tracts are Russia and Canada.BeforeA standard dot density map of population (each dot represents 50,000 people).  There is comfort in this view, because it is familiar, though that familiarity is a lie.  Or at least wildly imprecise.Below, I did the dot density mapping only inside my new clipped country shapes, where there is actually a population.  Overall there is much less visual country-to-country variability in the density, compared to the map above, but this is a much more accurate* picture of real population density.  Check out Australia.  Now, instead of implying every neighbor lives miles away, I get a truer sense of their actual population density.  I also get previously invisible insights into local distribution, like Egypt along the Nile, Canada in scattered cities nearer the border, Russia in their southwest, Algeria along the Mediterranean, and so on.  Dots dutifully avoid deserts, water, tundra, jungle, and more deserts.AfterA sort-of-dasymetric dot density map of population (each dot still represents 50,000 people).  While each country's overall population density (not all that meaningful, when you think about it) is harder to distinguish, the local population density is way truer.  But maybe misleadingly precise?*All of Cartography is a LieThe act of constraining a dot density map to more realistic (dasymetric) zones has a couple of drawbacks.  The first is that I lose that raw at-a-glance illustration of an overall national population density (though I would counter with the fact that this is a truer representation of actual local density). The second, and much bigger problem is emotional shenanigans.  A dasymetric dot density map can impart too great an expectation of precision.  Because I've taken the half-step of tighter population zones, it is entirely likely that readers assume more of its local distribution than is appropriate and take this is a direct and literal placement of people dots.  A problem of scale and false confidence.  The dot density map is still spraying dots randomly inside areas (it's just that the areas are more realistic).  India is a good example of this.  Because virtually all of India met the do people live here requirement (compared to scattered specks of population areas in the American west and pretty much all of Canada), all of India gets an evenly random dispersion of dots.  In reality there is a way higher density of folks living in the northeast band.  While this map doesn't have population data at that resolution, the precise speckles elsewhere in the world imply that it does.The Cartographic Uncanny ValleyAs a map-maker you will have to understand the balance of actual precision and perceived precision.  Doing your best to take steps toward an honest representation of a phenomenon could mayyyybe land you in the cartographic truth version of the uncanny valley.  Really generalized maps are clearly generalizations and are generously interpreted models of a phenomenon (at the cost of nuance).  Really precise maps are understood to be more literal pictures of where (at the cost of larger trends and scale-ability).  In-between precision can leave the reader wondering what level of scrutiny to apply which can inspire mistrust and revulsion.  So there's that.The uncanny valley.  The hypothetical emotional response in terms of perceived realism.  This concept may come into play when a map reader is unsure of the level of generalization a map is showing them.Tweet  Follow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fMLo-3f3eUg/UmfUvwRtV5I/AAAAAAAAC5E/XtQN4Bhz6a8/s640/CountriesLand.png|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 4})|>>"
"|>>The United Nations of Bitcoin|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/10/the-united-nations-of-bitcoin.html|>>","|>>This is a map of every Bitcoin download (that was able to be traced to a country), by operating system.  Each dot is an individual Bitcoin download.  The yellow dots are a general reference of all Bitcoin downloads ever while the red ones call out a specific OS used in the download.Bitcoin downloads by country, by operating system.  At least, when the specific country was known.  Of course there is plenty of geographically anonymous downloading (here's the nitty gritty on that).What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a digital currency that lives as an open source peer-to-peer system.  All cash systems are symbolic representations of value.  Historically they were representative of actually-valuable stuff held in reserve, but increasingly it works without a net as fully fiat, whereby it has no intrinsic value but represents the say-so of the institution that regulates it.  Bitcoin takes that a step further, as a cryptocurrency, which is not representative of reserved valuable stuff, and not regulated by any central authority and relies on the virtual exchange of Bitcoins (and fractions of Bitcoins) whose value is tied to demand.  I know, I don't really get it either.  Trading goats.  I can grasp that.  Bitcoin is mysterious to me -which makes it interesting.Closer LookI look for three things in the geographic dispersion.  The first is the overall relative density of the yellow points across the world (which, admittedly, is pretty much a map of internet users). The second is the overall penetration of each operating system (how red is the world, overall), in terms of Bitcoin users.  The third, and most interesting for me, is the relative popularity of Bitcoin-downloading operating systems by country (how red are the various countries compared to others).Reluctant Companion MapAnd, since Bitcoin downloads are intrinsically correlated with the population size, I made this lame choropleth map to illustrate the proportional variability in Bitcoin ""popularity"" by country.  It paints countries by their Bitcoin downloads as a percentage of the national population...I reluctantly made this dumb choropleth, ostensibly to tease out the proportional popularity of Bitcoin by population, but really to head off trolls who would undoubtedly point out their co-linearity if I hadn't (and of course include a link to the fun-at-first-but-way-over-used XKCD comic excoriating population-recursive heatmaps).  P.S. I recently fixed the legend, which had been high by one order of magnitude.About Those Dots...Yes, this is yet another foray into dot density mapping -but one that is a little more informed about the geography of population. The crux is, if I am scattering dots in countries based on the raw count of things (standard dot density territory), maybe I should more thoughtfully distribute them where people actually live (not-so-standard dot density territory).  More on how I made these maps here, but the cliff's notes version is I clipped Natural Earth's country boundaries by NASA's delineation of populated areas that have a population of at least 5 people per square kilometer.  I'm excited at the more meaningful dispersion areas that the dots get sprinkled into, but, like all of cartography, there are trade-offs.  I'll elaborate in a future post and give you my source data, so stay tuned.  In the meantime, help yourself to some twitter...Tweet  Follow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1QLnHqHEfuo/UmVHC3gHtUI/AAAAAAAAC3k/9aCMIwjZttk/s640/GlobalBitcoin.gif|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

"|>>The Dispersion of Life and Gender in New York|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/10/the-dispersion-of-life-and-gender-in.html|>>","|>>This is a dot map of every person in New York City, colored blue-green for males and pink for females, segmented throughout their ages.  It is an animated GIF map of the movement of life and gender in the city.  Each dot represents one person.The sexes start out homogeneous go super segregated in the teen years, segregate for business in the twenty-somethings, and re-couple for co-habitation years.  Then with the slow attrition of death, the lights fade into faint pockets of pink.Click here for an unreasonably bonkers version, which will take an eternity to load.Click here to pop out a more realistic file size for the web.Click here for a pointlessly small size that's still too big to be an effective thumbnail.Click here for a cute little thumbnail.and here to insult me with your cowardice.If you'd rather see them at-a-glance as an un-annotated set, you can go to their flickr page where they are tiled out sort of like a small multiple.Data SourcesI'm using simple tract-level population/gender counts from the US Census Bureau.  Because their tract boundaries extend into the water and vacant area, I used NYC's Bytes of the Big Apple zoning shapes to clip the census tracts to residentially zoned areas -giving me a more realistic (and more recognizable) definition of populated areas.  The census breaks out their population counts by gender for five-year age spans ranging from teeny tiny infants through esteemed 85+ year-olds.I had originally wanted to render the dots within the awesome actual building footprints of New York, but the census tract attribute in the PLUTO shapes are truncated and therefore largely useless for joining to other data. Believe me, I tried.  Anyway, Brandon Martin-Anderson succeeded at this already and made a beautiful bi-variate dot map of olders & youngers.Hat TipsI, along with most other cartographers these days, am really into dot density mapping.  It is way more truthful a means of presenting relative geographic dispersion and affiliation than, say, choropleth mapping, which will be the carto-whipping-post of 2013.I was inspired by the perpetually excellent work and insights of dot density heroes, Brandon Martin-Anderson, with his bold 1-for-1 crazy-detailed dot mapping of populations, Andy Woodruff, who artfully pushes dots for his beloved Boston and articulates why with style and wit, Ken Fields, who shares thoughtful and detailed production insights, and especially Kirk Goldsberry, whose beautiful pointillist maps of Texan politi-culture was the first of this magnitude and aesthetic that I'd seen.  Also, I've dabbled in it, too, making the obligatory election map, commuting maps, and walkability maps.A Closer LookExcluding color, this sequence of maps is a blooming, migration, and inevitable dimming, of life itself.  The addition of the gender color dimension means we can track at a more familial level the lifeline of New York residents.The population of babies.  I expected this to be thoroughly blended, as babies don't choose where to live and parents don't really choose neighborhoods based on the gender of their babies.As with the map of infants, the genders are still understandably mixed.  What is interesting in this age span is the general dearth of local youngsters in Lower and Midtown Manhattan.Certain neighborhoods begin to reveal themselves as comparatively popular places to raise teens.Now it gets interesting.  We are in the age-span where teens/young adults can choose where to live.  And they choose paths that are not gender-neutral.  Immediately we see clusters of females and, to a lesser extent, clusters of males.  What's the deal?  College. And prisons.Morningside Heights positively glows pink as the home of Barnard College, as do other institutions of learning sprinkled throughout Manhattan. The garment district is another draw.We also start to see the filling of Rikers Island with green dots as young men begin to populate the jail complex.Certainly a deviation in optimism between high-density young women neighborhoods and high-density young men neighborhoods.Now we reach the age of the young professional.  Early twenty-somethings are nearing the end of their education and entering the workforce.  For females, this apparently happens in Midtown Manhattan.For males, the SUNY Maritime College, and Yeshiva University have a much higher local population of males than females.  Also, of course, there is Rikers Island.The Upper West Side and Upper East Side continue to be popular places for young women to live, but twenty-something men are showing up for work, too.  Some areas of Queens show a greenish cloud of a male-heavy population.  It appears as though women in their late twenties outnumber their male counterparts in Brooklyn.Also notable in this age range is the migration to the suburbs.  By the way, ages 25 - 29 is the most populous group of New Yorkers.The early 30's shows the re-blending of the sexes, having been self-segregated since their early days out on their own.  Not since infancy have the genders been so mingled.  This 30-year echo is not a coincidence, since couples tend to create infants.  Trust me.Superblending.  Some neighborhoods are more gender stacked than others but for the most part male and female New Yorkers are blended.  Brooklyn is still pretty in pink, and the Bronx increasingly so.The early forties kicks off the re-segregation of the sexes.  Dense pockets of women form in neighborhoods in Brooklyn -and one neighborhood in Queens just east of the river from Roosevelt Island coalesces with forty-something women.Men are disproportionately (compared to similarly aged women) living around Chelsea.Men in their late forties continue to outnumber women in western Midtown.  The proportion of women seems to increase at the edges of the city.More of the same.Overall, the diminishing population is apparent.  But the Parkchester neighborhood in the Bronx remains popular with fifty-somethings of both ages.  Female enclaves throughout the city continue to concentrate.  Elmont, in Eastern Queens, seems an especially large popular residence of women in their late fifties.As retirement age approaches, men begin to leave Midtown.  Flushing and Elmhurst are relatively popular.Men continue to fall at a faster rate than women, throughout the city.The lights are going out.  Retirement communities in pockets of Manhattan and Brighton Beach emerge.Two neighborhoods are holdouts for octogenarian men.  They make a final stand in Brighton Beach and Turtle Bay.At 85 and older, New York is essentially pink.  Women outnumber the remaining men at a rate of better than two to one.  Various retirement communities popular with women become apparent, almost as strongly as their geographic preferences in their teens and twenties.  Those two eras mark their times without men, when whole neighborhoods are almost empty of males their peer.  The boys have moved on.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Naq05q0b9y0/UlLCmhw3GdI/AAAAAAAACzs/hMzoZbOxhfU/s640/AnimatedGenderPopNYC.gif|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

"|>>Football Game-Day Traffic Fatalities|>>","|>>http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2013/08/football-game-day-traffic-fatalities.html|>>","|>>Over ten seasons, it appears that the overall number of local traffic fatalities is not impacted one way or the other by a pro football game happening in town.  But if you look at individual cities, there are some interesting examples at the edges.To be clear, this is not a map of traffic fatalities vs. drivers who didn't die (that would be hard).  Nor is it a map of game-day fatalities vs. all other fatalities throughout the year (that would be unfair).  It is just a comparison of a stadium's region when the home team is in town vs when it is playing somewhere else (which is a pretty tight control group) -and the different traffic conditions that implies.This map does not imply that a football game has anything to with any individual traffic fatality, and over the course of 80 home game-days and 80 away game-days most locations tended to be generally even (to my initial surprise, given the tens of thousands of vehicles making a dedicated pilgrimage).  But throughout ten seasons, some cities start to build up a surprisingly lopsided count.Why? I don't know.Because I'm comparing home game-days with away game-days, the seasonal and day-of-week variabilities in traffic risk should fall away (group A and group B happen throughout the same time of year and generally happen on the same days of the week).  The biggest variation that the data accounts for is whether 60 thousand or so people simultaneously converge in a single place and then depart.  In many cases, the number of overall game-day local traffic fatalities was too low (thankfully) to support statistical rigor in a home/away comparison.  But not for all locations.Before I started putting the data together, my hunch was that home games would correlate to higher traffic fatalities.  That just seemed to be the intuitive notion.  I only thought of it because of a really treacherous snowy driving experience I had getting to and from a game.  But the more I thought about it, and as the results started bucking that assumption, I reconsidered.  While on one hand you have a massive migration and perhaps more traffic (an increased candidate population), on the other hand you have 60+ thousand people who are not driving for three hours and a carefully choreographed herd of comparably slow moving vehicles (which will have traffic incidents but not necessarily fatal ones) when they are driving.  Add to that local football cultures that have a strong tailgating community and you have an even longer stretch of non-driving (does tailgating save lives?).So what accounts for some cities having a rather large proportion of home game-day incidents while others have significantly less in comparison?  This has to be a pretty complex question involving local culture (tourism footprint, tailgating culture, proximity and travel mode of attendees), the proportion of a local team's impact on the transportation infrastructure, the nature of that transportation infrastructure, and the availability of public transportation.  Even over ten seasons, do some locations' other sporting venues bias the proportions one way or another?  And who knows what else. Where are the Bay Area, NYC, and DC teams? The nature of this map looks at an individual team's local area.  When local areas overlap with other local areas it muddles the home and away differentiation.  So they could not be considered in this map.DataLocal drive-time areas were generated by Visual Fusion at a ""distance"" on one hour (non-traffic) based on an underlying OpenStreetMap transportation network.  You can download these geo-amoebas directly, here (this link will prompt to download a zip file, about 280k).  Teams that had geographically significant stadium changes within the ten-season study period are accounted for (Dallas, Philly, Arizona, Detroit, Seattle). Other teams got new stadiums but they neighbored their predecessor so it didn't impact the drive-time area.Historic team schedules (including home/away info) were gathered from the Pro-Football-Reference website.Historic traffic fatality data was downloaded from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's FARS database.  Unfortunately, data for 2012 has not yet (at the time of map making) been released, so the whole 2011 football season had to be excluded because of games that occurred on Jan 1 of 2012 (to exclude only that week of football would make the number of home and away games lopsided).This map was made in collaboration with cartographer, Josh Stevens, who tweets as @jscarto.P.S. If you feel raw about this map, maybe because your city has what appears to be a comparably dangerous home game day, it may be just as likely that the city is especially safe on away game days.TweetFollow @JohnNelsonIDV|>>","|>>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4bK0zGZ52KA/Uhz3ZejurwI/AAAAAAAACzM/SJytT1hMrpo/s640/GameDayTrafficFatalities.png|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 4})|>>"

I can track one location throughout a year to compare the annual push and pull of snow and plant life there, while in my periphery I see the oscillating wave of life advancing and retreating, advancing and retreating.  And I'm reassured by it.Of course there are the global characteristics of climate and the nature of land to heat and cool more rapidly than water.  The effects of warm currents feeding a surprisingly mild climate in the British Isles.  The snowy head start of winter in high elevations like the Himalayas, Rockies, and Caucuses, that spread downward to join the later snowiness of lower elevations.  The continental wave of growing grasses in African plains.But, overall, to me it looks like breathing. And my pixel is right at an interesting intersection of life and ice, where the longest night of the year feels like forever, and the longest day of the year is a like a battery strapped to my back.

Perhaps no wonder, then, that the chaotic Venezuelan capital ranks as one of the world's priciest cities  as high inflation rates, chronic food shortages and a currency black market drive the cost of living for average residents through the roof (even as petrol remains jawdroppingly cheap).But Caracas is not alone  from Tokyo to Singapore, unaffordable megalopolises are crippling their less fortunate residents.

Find out which are the most borrowed titlesWhich are the most popular titles and authors in UK libraries? And how has the number of people borrowing books changed over the years?The latest data from the Public Lending Right (PLR), which manages payments to authors, shows the top 100 most borrowed books in the UK in 2012-13. Lee Child's The Affair was the most popular library book in 2012-13 with almost 80,000 loans, knocking the 10th Anniversary by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro from the top spot. A Wanted Man, also by Lee Child, was the second most popular while Fifty Shades of Grey became the third most borrowed book in UK libraries in 2012-13. John Dugdale writes today:There's something to please almost everyone in Public Lending Right's latest rankings of library borrowings, covering July 2012 to June 2013. Patriots can rejoice in the top three places being unusually captured by British writers, with a double for Lee Child and EL James picking up a much-needed PLR cheque too (6.20p per book borrowed, but capped at £6,600 per author).Lovers of tradition and continuity will like the fact that James Patterson is the UK's most borrowed author for the seventh year running, scoring 15 entries in the top 100.

"|>>jsonlite gets a triple mushroom boost!|>>","|>>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RBloggers/~3/ZZ3hDH9Iq74/|>>","|>>
The jsonlite package is a JSON parser/generator optimized for the web. It implements a bidirectional mapping between JSON data and the most important R data types, which allows for converting objects to JSON and back without manual data restructuring. This is ideal for interacting with web APIs, or to build pipelines where data seamlessly flow in and out of R through JSON. The quickstart vignette gives a brief introduction, or just try:
fromJSON(toJSON(mtcars))
Or use some data from the web:
# Latest commits in r-base
r_source <- fromJSON(""https://api.github.com/repos/wch/r-source/commits"")

# Pretty print:
committer <- format(r_source$commit$author$name)
date <- as.Date(r_source$commit$committer$date)
message <- sub(""nn.*"","""", r_source$commit$message)
paste(date, committer, message)
New in 0.9.11: performance!
Version 0.9.11 has a few minor bugfixes, but most of the work of this release has gone into improving performance. The implementation of toJSON has been optimized in many ways, and with a little help from Winston Chang, the most CPU intensive bottleneck has been ported to C code. The result is quite impressive: encoding dataframes to row-based JSON format is about 3x faster, and encoding dataframes to column-based JSON format is nearly 10x faster in comparision with the previous release.
The diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 package has about 0.5 million values which makes a nice benchmark. On my macbook it takes jsonlite on average 1.18s to encode it to row-based JSON, and 0.34s for column-based json:
library(jsonlite)
library(microbenchmark)
data(""diamonds"", package=""ggplot2"")
microbenchmark(json_rows <- toJSON(diamonds), times=10)
# Unit: seconds
#              expr     min       lq   median       uq     max neval
#  toJSON(diamonds) 1.12773 1.140724 1.175872 1.180354 1.21786    10

microbenchmark(json_columns <- toJSON(diamonds, dataframe=""col""), times=10)
# Unit: milliseconds
#                                 expr      min      lq   median       uq      # max neval
#  toJSON(diamonds, dataframe = ""col"") 333.9494 334.799 338.0843 340.0929 350.3026    10
Parsing and simplification performance
The performance of fromJSON has been improved as well. The parser itself was already a high performance c++ library that was borrowed from RJSONIO, which has not changed. However the simplification code used to reduce deeply nested lists into nice vectors and data frames has been tweaked in many places and is on average 3 to 5 times faster than before (depending on what the JSON data look like). For the diamonds example, the row-based data gets parsed in about 2.32s and column based data in 1.25s.
microbenchmark(fromJSON(json_rows), times=10)
# Unit: seconds
#                 expr      min       lq   median       uq      max neval
#  fromJSON(json_rows) 2.178211 2.278337 2.319519 2.376085 2.423627    10

microbenchmark(fromJSON(json_columns), times=10)
# Unit: seconds
#                    expr     min       lq   median       uq      max neval
#  fromJSON(json_columns) 1.17289 1.252284 1.253999 1.265763 1.306357    10
For comparison, we can also disable simplification in which case parsing takes respectively 0.70 and 0.39 seconds for these data. However without simplification we end up with a big nested list of lists which is often not very useful.
microbenchmark(fromJSON(json_rows, simplifyVector=F), times=10)

"|>>Keep your team informed with “slackr”|>>","|>>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RBloggers/~3/T_xchQ30FGo/|>>","|>>Karl Broman did a spiffy job summarizing a good number of the options available to R folk if they want to get notifications from R. You can also generate OS X notifications as well. If you’re using Slack for team coordination and communications, you’ve got a new option - slackr that also enables you go a bit deeper than just notifications, letting you push R output to the service for sharing results or observations.
What is Slack?
Slack (@SlackHQ) is a cloud-hosted, team messaging platform that lets you setup public & private internal channels for various types of communications, incuding markdown, text, pictures, video, links and more. They also offer connectivity with many outside services (e.g. github, twitter, etc.). The service is painless to setup, and there are desktop and mobile applications for most platforms (as well as the web interface). It has the utility of e-mail, twitter and skype (and more) combined, and their API makes it possible to create your own integrations.
While their full API affords more flexibility, they have simple “webhook”-type integrations that are more lightweight and make quick work out connecting to Slack. The slackr package takes advantage of the webook API to connect R with the service. To use it, you’ll first need to signup for the service and get your teammates to join and then setup the webhook integration.
Why slackr?
If you’ve ever used a plaintext messaging tool (e.g. Skype) to try to share R code snippets or output, you know the drill: select what was sent to you; copy, then paste into a text editor so it’s actually readable. The slackr package eliminates those steps by letting you execute one function - slackr() - and send any R output/expression to any Slack team channel or team member. Here’s an example, using the code from the lm stats package function example code (hit up ?lm in R to see that directly):
# setup the slackr API. this example assumes a .slackr config file in ~/
slackrSetup()

# run the lm() example
ctl <- c(4.17,5.58,5.18,6.11,4.50,4.61,5.17,4.53,5.33,5.14)
trt <- c(4.81,4.17,4.41,3.59,5.87,3.83,6.03,4.89,4.32,4.69)
group <- gl(2, 10, 20, labels = c(""Ctl"",""Trt""))
weight <- c(ctl, trt)
lm.D9 <- lm(weight ~ group)
lm.D90 <- lm(weight ~ group - 1) # omitting intercept

# share the results with Jay
slackr(anova(lm.D9), summary(lm.D90), channel=""@jayjacobs"")

Here’s what will be seen in the slack channel:

The slackr() function can also be setup to do trivial notifications (and the various Slack apps and integrations can notify you anywhere in an out of slack, if that’s your cup of tea):
performSomeLongClassifictationTask()

# notify me directly
slackr(""Classification complete"", channel=""@hrbrmstr"")

# or notify the default channel
slackr(""Classification complete"")


With slackrSetup(), you can choose the default channel and username, as well as select the icon being used (overriding the default one during the initial webhook setup). The config file (mentioned earlier) is pretty straightforward:
token: YOUR_SLACK_API_TOKEN
channel: #general
username: slackr
icon_emoji: :information_source:
incoming_webhook_url: https://YOURTEAM.slack.com/services/hooks/incoming-webhook?

and definitely beats passing all those in as parameters (and, doesn’t have to live in ~/.slackr if you want to use an alternate location or have multiple profiles for multiple teams).
The webhook API is text/rich-text-only, but the full API lets you send anything. For that, full OAuth setup is required, and since it’s super-simple to just drag graphics from an RStudio window to Slack the extra functionality hasn’t made it to the slackr project TODO list yet, but I can defintely see a ggslack() or even a dev.slack() graphics device (ala png()) function or two making their way to the package in the not-too-distant future.
How to get slackr

The slackr package is up on github and may make it to CRAN next week. Over the coming weeks we’ll probably add the ability to consume output from slack channels and definitely welcome any issues, comments or feature requests.|>>","|>>http://datadrivensecurity.info/blog/images/2014/09/slack01.png|>>","|>>Counter({'data': 2, 'visualization': 1})|>>"

Because the golden age of modern children’s books took place in the middle of the twentieth century, on the cusp of the civil rights movement and decades before the second wave of feminism, it is unsurprising that the genre, even today, is burdened by the cultural baggage of inequality — only 31 percent of contemporary children’s books feature female heroines, many of which purvey limiting gender expectations, and of the 3,200 children’s books published in 2013 only 93 featured people of color.
And yet here is a book about an independent middle-aged woman who defies the still-prevalent stigma against singletons and is financially self-sufficient by her own creative labor, who is white and services a wealthy black client, and who is helped into the dénouement of her challenge not by a patronizing Prince Charming but by a little black girl dressed in preppy plaid. There is, too, the many-hatted citizenry of wildly diverse backgrounds and callings, joined together in a common cause of goodwill.

We can predict who will use more sunscreen next week based on how their brain responds to an ad today. The brain regions that seem to be critical to that are brain regions involved in social thinking, in thinking about yourself and thinking about other people. So this seems to be more about our identity and the identities that we’re capable of trying on. If I can’t try on the identity that you’re suggesting to me—being a sunscreen-using person, or a nonsmoker, or something like that—the ad is much less likely to stick.
[…]
William James said long ago that we have as many identities as people that we know, and probably more than that. We are different with different people. I’m different with my son than I am with you. We have these different identities that we try on, and they surround us… I’m really interested in looking at that as a mechanism of persuasion when it comes to regular old persuasion, when it comes to education, when it comes to public health, and when it comes to international issues as well. It’s finding that latitude of acceptance and finding out how to use it successfully.” - UCLA neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman, author of Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect, studies ""latitudes of acceptance"" to understand what makes us change our minds – something we’re notoriously reluctant to do.

There are three things that are important: First, if you want to write, you need to keep an honest, unpublishable journal that nobody reads, nobody but you. Where you just put down what you think about life, what you think about things, what you think is fair and what you think is unfair. And second, you need to read. You can’t be a writer if you’re not a reader. It’s the great writers who teach us how to write. The third thing is to write. Just write a little bit every day. Even if it’s for only half an hour — write, write, write.” - Wisdom from Madeleine L’Engle, quoted in her biography.

I don’t think it’s a matter of overcoming [our] fears — fears are fears, and we have a reptilian brain which we can’t simply turn on and turn off… It is critical to live despite those fears – if you’re waiting for the fears to go away, they’re not. You have to make a decision that you want [what you want] more than you want to be held back or self-protected by those fears.” - A magnificent conversation with Debbie Millman, who is an incessant source of wisdom on how to live a good life and how to muster the courage necessary for a creative career. |>>","|>>none|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

For my latest submission for rhizomedotorg, a selection of sculptural projects from the mid-60s onwards that employ the computer in the creative process.

As with all fields of the arts, the role of computing in the field of sculpture and form-fabrication is rapidly growing. 3D printing is the most obvious example, with its now familiar method of taking a 3D design file and producing a physical object to match, line upon line from the supporting surface upwards. Also, with the assistance of programmable electronics, installations of arranged matter can be maneuvered into various forms and performances, receptive to local stimuli or external data, all of which is connected to an out-of-range laptop orchestrating the spectacle. 
For this submission, though, the aim is to explore some of the earliest examples of computing and sculpture, by artists who were in a position to explore the potential in an at-the-time esoteric field. These artists glimpsed the possibilities and problems that emerge when the object becomes a digital entity, long before the rise of 3d printing.

Artists include Zdeněk Sýkora, Robert Mallary, Nicholas Negroponte, José Luis Alexanco, Ron Resch and Isa Genzken.

"|>>Ways Of Something
Net Art collaborative project curated by Lorna...|>>","|>>http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/96534720131|>>","|>>      Ways Of Something
Net Art collaborative project curated by Lorna Mills is a reinterpretation of the landmark British 1972 documentary on reading art, ‘Ways Of Seeing’.
The second episode (concerned with the woman in art) makes its debut at the Transfer Gallery in Brooklyn on September 6th. For each 28 minute episode, an artist was assigned one minute of the original narration to produce visuals for. All the work was organized online.
Here is a sample clip put together by gabycepeda from the latest episode:


‘Ways of Something’, is a contemporary remake of John Berger’s BBC documentary, “Ways of Seeing” (1972). Commissioned by The One Minutes, at the Sandberg Instituut in Amsterdam and compiled by Lorna Mills, the project consists of one-minute videos by fifty eight web-based artists who commonly work with 3D rendering, gifs, film remix, webcam performances, and websites to describe the cacophonous conditions of artmaking after the internet.The screening at TRANSFER Gallery is based on the first two episodes of a four-part series of thirty-minute films created by art theorist John Berger and produced by Mike Dibb. In the original episode one, voice-of-God narration over iconic European paintings offer a careful dissection of traditional “fine art” media and the way society has come to understand them as art. The second episode is a contentious and sometimes maddening look at the female nude in the western tradition. The combined work is, in effect, art about art about television about the internet.
“Ways Of Something,” Screening + Discussion, Episode 1: Daniel Temkin, Rollin Leonard, Sara Ludy, Rhett Jones, Jaakko Pallasvuo, Dafna Ganani, Jennifer Chan, Rea McNamara, Theodore Darst, Matthew Williamson, Hector Llanquin, Christina Entcheva, V5MT, Marisa Olson, Joe McKay, Carla Gannis, Nicholas O’Brien, Eva Papamargariti, Rosa Menkman, Kristin Lucas, Jeremy Bailey & Kristen D. Schaffer, Giselle Zatonyl, Paul Wong, Alfredo Salazar-Caro, Sally McKay, RM Vaughan & Keith Cole & Jared Mitchell, Andrew Benson, Christian Petersen, Faith Holland, Jennifer McMackon; Episode 2: Kevin Heckart, Geraldine Juarez, Gaby Cepeda, Angela Washko, Emilie Gervais, LaTurbo Avedon, Lyla Rye, Mattie Hillock, Antonio Roberts, Georges Jacotey, Daniel Rourke, Sandra Rechico & Annie Onyi Cheung, Yoshi Sodeoka, Alma Alloro, LoVid, Andrea Crespo, Ad Minoliti, Arjun Ram Srivatsa, Carrie Gates, Isabella Streffen, Esteban Ottaso, ZIL & ZOY, Hyo Myoung Kim, Jesse Darling, Tristan Stevens, Erica Lapadat-Janzen, Claudia Hart, Anthony Antonellis, 7pm-10pm, TRANSFER Gallery, Brooklyn.

Latest essay from Paddy Johnson for artnet looks into how Tumblr has paid a huge part in the file format as an art medium:

A Tumblr-based art world, generally speaking, is defined a little more broadly than the art world defines itself. The dashboard removes context the way a Google image search does, so that may have something do with its democratic nature. Articles and lists about artists on Tumblr typically include artists with little to no connection to the art world—mathematicians, animators, computer programmers, etc—as well as artists who work the gallery and museum circuit.

Highlighted artists and shoutouts go to dvdp, threeframes, annstreetstudio, hellyeahcinemagraphs, mrdiv, hexeosis, echophon, zwian, beesandbombs, adamferriss, slimjimstudios, cindysuen, hoppip, michaelshillingburg, centolodigiani, brentsgifs, lolumadclub, twohundredfiftysixcolors, joehamilton, francoiseditelagrivoise, kimasendorf, scorpiondagger, evapapamargariti, vincemckelvie, wolfandunicorn, laturbo, cloaque, 15folds, and myself …

A GIF artwork on ebay, hoping to be the ‘most expensive GIF of all time” and make $5,800:

""Balloon Dog Deflated"" (www.luxuryobj.tumblr.com/post/95388265108) is a GIF animation by the net artist Michael Green, an excerpt from his tumblr GIF series “luxury.obj” (www.luxuryobj.tumblr.com) which explores the desire of class “objects” through the replication and representation of the original object, with specific attention detailed on the essence of the object itself, through the use of various digital lighting and texture techniques. “Balloon Dog Deflated” is an ironic re-working of the 12 foot stainless steel sculpture “Balloon Dog” (1994) by Jeff Koons, which sold in an auction for $58 million dollars, which according to The New York Times, claims that the sculpture is “the most expensive work sold by an artist in an auction”  Jeff Koons would have a staff of the most skilled “employed” craftsmen to compose his work …… The museum of 2o14 is the internet. The museum is in Tumblr, the most relevant “space” for the culture to see any work of art and/or image related/unrelated; the spectator and the relationship of the image. Physical museums, like compact discs and books are dead. It’s in the cloud now, and it is time to embrace this fact and make the essence of an art object relevant to everyday society …

WHY 5,800 DOLLARS? Jeff Koons sold his original “Balloon Dogs” through a physical auction for a record $58 million dollars. HISTORY ALWAYS REPEATS ITSELF. Here we are, 20 years later on ebay (a digital auction) with the same artwork, created in the medium of our times (3D animation/GIF) , about to make history once again. When you commit to buying the original GIF file, rendered directly from the artist’s computer, you will be making history, as you will have purchased the most expensive bitmap image format in the history of mankind …

Creative coding project by Jason Lin can convert text into 3D geometric drawings, turning writing into a visual grammar - video embedded below:


My latest Processing project!
… I came up with this idea because my last project used an excel sheet and received insane amounts of numbers and data. This time I wanted to use a text file and receive insane amounts of words and letters and most importantly, punctuation!
I had seen pictures of “sentence maps” before where a line was created and it got longer with every word and made a turn every time the sentence ended. Colors would change with every character or some other factor.
Basically I wanted to take this idea and make it HUGE. I wanted an entire 3D explore-able environment.
 The video explains what I chose to do for every single type of punctuation mark.

Fashion remix project from gokinjo-monozukuri captures existing fashion with 3D photogrammetry, processed into polygons with modelling software, and put together onto digitally printed fabric - video embedded below:


The process of “Computed Copy” is as follows. First, scan the garment and get the 3D images of it. Second, make flat patterns with printed images by using a software which can do this automatically, and finally put the parts by sewing them. Although there is a traditional way of designing flat patterns which considers the movement of the body and characteristics of the material, computers design it in a totally different way, because they recognize the 3D shape as a polygon which is a collective form of flat faces. Our purpose for this “Computed Copy” is not only to make some distortion which humans cannot produce, but also to make garments which are not just “copy” and have the alternative creativity. By removing humans’ arbitrariness as much as possible from the process of copying designs, and by letting computers do it, we can create a new kind of designing system. In the future, we think that it will be possible to copy a garment only with the image files on the internet without scanning actual things, thanks to the rapid development of 3D technology (scanning, modeling, and printing) and a flood of images on the internet. We expect that this work will be the fastest automated way of copying the designs as the final destination of fast fashion.

Web game by Netro where you travel through Google Streetview areas to locate celebrities via sound - video embedded below:



Today something creepy and not imaginable happened. A virus born in the depth of the Internet shut down Google Street View and kicked millions of users out of their routine lives. Riots, cruel violence and total anarchy on the streets were the result of the day Google Street View stood still.
Now it s your turn to help to rescue the world. 10 ultimate level, totally crazy places and mysterious missions. You will see a lot of celebrities who will help you or not. Keep calm and press play. Maybe you will be the conquer of the virus and there is no longer the day Google Street View stood still.

The Day Google Street View Stood Still is a parasite game that uses Google Street View as the game stage. Additionally it makes use of the Web Audio API, to place audio objects directly in the Street View space. The 3 dimensional audio rendering makes it possible to localize game objects via its sound representation. Gamers may use of their Headphones to easily orientate and find the level exit.

German iOS video app can display your recordings in a panoramic viewpoint, including direction and orientation.

[Google Translation:]
Motion Picture 2.0 represents a new type of video recording.You can rotate, can change the ratio for viewing pictures and movies … the app also stores the camera movements when shooting.
The novelty of the videos in this app that they do not stand still fixed in a picture, on a screen or a screen during playback. The rectangular image section of your video moves when playing on a 360 ° screen from left to right, or from top to bottom, tilts and rotates around its own axis, depending on how you’ve moved on taking pictures.

I then made the following four basic charts as an introduction to the revenue and spending of the Jersey City Municipal Government.The first graph compares the municipal budget to the JC agency budgets. Then a simple stacked bar chart to compare the major revenue sources vs the city spending. Final two charts provide more detail into the revenue and spending Data can be found on our project page. The Board of Education budget is approximately 150 million dollars more than the city's municipal budget however most of the funding for the schools is from NJ state government. 

				
			
			
		
	
	
 The top 3 sources of revenue for Jersey City (80%) are property taxes, abatements (properties with tax breaks offered to owners/developers) and state aid. While 71% of the spending goes to 5 major items: police, health insurance, debt payments, fire, and pensions.

				
			
			
		
	
	
 The other revenues for the city, the bottom 20%, are from licenses, fees, permits, sale of land, taxes collect for library etc...

				
			
			
		
	
	
 Finally, while the autonomous agencies have separate budgets, they will receive payments from the city which cover some of their costs. For example the Incinerator Authority gets $34 million while the Library get $8 million and the Parking Authority get around $1 million.

An update of a previous post comparing the average compound rolling returns (adjusted for inflation) for both stocks and gold over 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 year intervals. For the period 1928-2013, the average annual compound real return of stocks = 6.3% and gold = 2.0%. However, the price of gold was controlled by the government until the mid-70s when the US finally abandoned the gold standard. For the period 1976-2013, the average returns were stocks = 7.2% and gold = 2.0%. Gold Data from MeasuringWorth.

During the course of making my book, I took a look at the GDP Industry data from the Bureau of Economics Analysis and I decided to graph the 60 years of data showing the share of each industry in the US economy. Each graph is on the same x- and y-scales to support comparisons across all of them. At the same time I thought it would be helpful to list out some of the activities found in each industry so that these charts could be used as an introduction to the dataset.  FInally, I ordered the industries from the largest to smallest across four pages.Each area graph was created with OmniGraphSketcher and the final layout and annotations were made using Illustrator.Datasource: US Bureau of Economic Analysis. “Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by Industry Data.” June 2012. http://www.bea.gov/industry/gdpbyind_data.htm.

However, this consumer data focuses on families income groups below $150,000 a year and does not tell us what the spending patterns of the top 1% (incomes above $350,000) or top 0.1% (incomes above $1.5 million)Read Online to view all to the graphics from my book.  These graphs were created using OmniGraphSketcher copied into Adobe Illustrator for additional annotations. Data Source: Dolfman, Michael L., and Denis M.

After receiving requests to use some of my graphs in textbooks, emails from teachers and recommendations by EducationWorld and the Library of Congress, I decided to create a series of Powerpoint presentations for teachers. In my first Powerpoint slide deck, I have created and updated examples of exponential growth in economics and finance. This historical data is annotated by major events and covers, in some cases, 200 years of US history. They are useful for interdisciplinary classwork in economics, social studies history as well as math. Besides demonstrating how the logarithmic scale works, this collection of graphs provides examples that show how log scales can illustrate percent changes and growth rates. I release my work with a CREATIVE COMMONS BY-NC license so you are free to share/copy these graphs for educational or personal use after you purchase it.See other product for sale in my shop.

From An Illustrated Guide to Income in the United States.Growing income inequality can be seen across many different statistics in my book. For example when average and median incomes diverge, this is a red flag for growing inequality since the increasingly higher incomes that can be found among corporate executives, celebrity and hedge fund mangers can shift average income without affecting the median* income. Take a look at how the average (mean) and median income diverge for family households over the last 35 years. This implies that the income growth of lower-income households has not kept up with the income growth high-income households. Over the same time period, the median income of family households with only 1 income earner didn't change while the median income of 2, 3, 4 and no earner households continued to grow. When I took a look at gender, I saw that the average income grew faster than the median for both men and women. However, for men, this divergence of average and median income started after the late-1970s, when their median income growth flatten (similar to lack of growth in the 1 earner households). However, for women this divergence of average and median income is not as dramatic and can be seen back to the 1950s.Also interesting was that this pattern (no growth of median income since the late-1970s with continued growth of average income) was very clear in their chart for white men. Especially compared to the other race/sex combinations. Finally, I saw this visual pattern (a change in the growth rates since the 1970s) when comparing the growth of GDP per Person vs GDP per WorkerGDP per Person vs Average Unskilled Wages Labor Productivity (Output per Hour) vs Real Hourly Compensation*Median is the value at which half of the people (or households or tax returns) make less and half make more. This is also referred to as the “50th percentile.” Read Online to view all to the graphics from my book.  These graphs were created using OmniGraphSketcher copied into Adobe Illustrator for additional annotations. Data from Officer, Lawrence H., and Samuel H.

From An Illustrated Guide to Income in the United States. For each industry, I plotted the 10-year growth in jobs against the their 2011 average earnings*.  The drop in Manufacturing sector is very dramatic, but  notice, there are several sectors with higher average earnings than Manufacturing that saw their number of jobs increase (like Finance & Insurance). However, all of these sectors had significantly fewer jobs in 2001 compared to Manufacturing. These higher earning sectors (like Professional, Scientific and Technical Service) are dominated by jobs that require more education than most of the Manufacturing jobs. It is important to note, that today, not all of the jobs in Manufacturing are high paying jobs; even in this sector you find the highest paying jobs requiring a post-secondary degree). BTW, take a look at the wages of US Production Workers back 200 years for comparison to the recent trends.*Average Earnings is calculated by EMSI from wages, salaries, and proprietor earnings for pensions, insurance plans, profit-sharing plans, retirement plans, compensation plans, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans, as well as employer contributions to government social insurance. Read Online to view all to the graphics from my book about change in jobs by industry. Graph created using OmniGraphSketcher and Adobe Illustrator. Data from EMSI (Economic Modeling Specialists International).

From my book An Illustrated Guide to Income, I examine the changes in tax rates for the highest incomes in the US. The top graph shows the average tax rate since the 1940s for the Top 0.01% of income earners (in 2010, the approximately 15,000 returns reporting more than $8 million dollars in income). The bottom graph (based on my popular Tax Rates poster) gives an overview of the different ""income"" taxes in the United States by illustrating the marginal tax rate* for individuals, corporations and capital gains from the sale of stocks or real estate. You can see how the decrease in these top rates (especially the capital gains tax rate) mirror the decrease in the average rate for very high income earners.*The top tax rate or marginal tax rate is the rate you pay on the “last dollar” you earn; but when you view the taxes you paid as a percentage of your income, your effective tax rate is less than your marginal rate, especially after you take into account the deductions and exemptions, i.e. income that is not subject to any tax.Look at more pages from my book or buy it online.Graphs created using OmniGraphSketcher and annotated in Illustrator. Data from the following: Citizens for Tax Justice. “Top Federal Income Tax Rates Since 1913.” November 2011. http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf. Hungerford, Thomas L. “Taxes and the Economy: An Economic Analysis of the Top Tax Rates Since 1945.” Congressional Research Service, Report no.

"|>>This Artist Is Trying (And Failing) To Draw Every Person In New York|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/this-artist-is-trying-and-failing-to-draw-every-person-in-new-york|>>","|>>


	 

This article originally appeared on VICE.com. Photos by Matthew Leifheit

	 

	Artist Jason Polan is trying to draw every person in New York City, and he’s failing.

	 

	Over six years ago, the idea formed in his head, and when it existed in the laboratory that sits between his ears, the concept was so simple, so clean, so utterly perfect in the way a circle drawn by some theoretical supercomputer is perfect. A) There is New York. B) There are people in New York. So, C) There could exist a total, whole and complete document of Every Person in New York.

	 

	But then, just after conception, the idea left his head and entered the world—as any art that ends up actually existing does—and became subject to the brutal elements of this sloppy place where drawing a perfect circle is, it turns out, inherently impossible. Suddenly, “Every Person in New York” was flawed, messy, ugly even.

	 




		Jason wouldn’t know if he was drawing residents, tourists or those just passing through. He could go door-to-door with piles of census data, but there’d still be plenty of people who existed off the grid, or people who moved here since the last data collection, or babies being born, or people dying, or some other factor that made New York a subject that just wouldn’t sit still. Any way he approached it, there would be countless tiny gaps in a portrait of the city, holes that would render the thing fatally incomplete. And even if Polan somehow disentangled this logistical puzzle, there was still the most glaring problem of all: He would have to draw something like 14 people an hour for 70 years to include “every person.”

		 

		In short, an idea was born in Jason Polan’s head perfect, and when exposed to the cruel inadequacies of existence, it turned unrecognizably imperfect, leaving Polan with just one way to restore the thing to its original state of immaculate beauty: Finish it.

		 

		And so, Polan walks the streets of New York City everyday with his pen and notepad, “failing.” He draws portrait after portrait after portrait, works on side projects (often at MOMA), and every so often, he organizes meetings of the Taco Bell Drawing Club (exactly what it sounds like) so that he can share his experience with others. He does it all with a smile on his face, never frustrated or defeated, totally comfortable playing a game that he full well knows is rigged. In fact, he seems happy just to be playing at all, proud to be playing as hard as he is.

		 



		 


			It’s almost as if Polan has come to terms with what lies at the core of one of art’s great intrinsic dilemmas: The whole thing is, by its very nature, a sisyphean task. That is, in the context of all our constructions surrounding stuff like truth and representation, art is always an attempt at something impossible. It always fails. It’s never perfect because in order to exist, it must exist in the imperfect place we call “here.”

			 

			See, Polan could have created a portrait of New York the way most sane artists/documentarians probably would, selecting a diverse range of characters that are meant to “represent” the entire city. He could have drawn a handful of people from every borough, a handful of people of every race, a handful of people of every economic standing, and so on, stopping when he felt like the story was told. But while employing that tactic might have yielded a successful finished product, that product would always contain a misleading simplicity, a false neatness. It would have been an artistic document presenting itself as the real deal when, in some sense, it’s the consolation prize. It would have been the ever-practical seven colored rainbow posing as the entire color continuum.





			Instead, Jason Polan indulges failure. He meanders around the super well-traveled intersection of art and mortality by meandering around NYC all day, reaching for the proverbial stars in earnest. He doesn’t gloss over or circumvent the impossibilities inherent in art. He makes them his subject. 

			 

			Earlier in his career, Polan drew every kernel of popcorn in a microwave popcorn bag and called the project “An Entire Bag of Popcorn.” It’s the counterpoint to his city-sized magnum opus, in that the scope is so small, the task so doable. But even then, in what might be the most ridiculous of his many projects, Polan was making ambitious art about art. When he sat in his living room, meticulously organizing each kernel so as not to draw the same one twice or drop one on the floor, he was, consciously or not, conducting some strange artsy experiment by doing what any scientist worth his salt does: Examine the small to understand the big.




				It’s no suprise that Polan always says MOMA is his favorite place in the whole wide world—at his core, he’s a fan. He’s the kind of guy capable of being in awe of art. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the sort of thing that gets hung on prestigious white walls or just some friend’s basement creation. If it’s something that has the gumption to fail and fail spectacularly, it’s good, and maybe, a little miraculous.

::neighbors_140831b

	Through the many portals on his website, digital media artist James Proctor lays down a virtual map of a mind in flux, one in constant search for new artistic vistas through creative coding, GIF animation, and pixel sorting, amongst other digital media.

	The site features such works as rgbRods, inspired by Kim Asendorf's pixel sorting code, by which Proctor references the human eye's photoreceptors. Wanting to fashion an entirely “synthetic composition”—one without photographic or other source material—Proctor plotted two loops on X and Y axes to create a shimmering, prismatic sheet that hangs in the void.  

hypno6_130B

	For his animated GIFs, Proctor experimented in three dimensions to see how generated objects behaved when set in motion. The Spiral GIF, for instance, is an optical treat inspired by pixel sorting, but with overwritten and destroyed pixels to generate the imagery. Bezier Construct 5, with its curved and colored shapes melting into one another, is another animated gem.

	Proctor, however, set the GIFs and pixel sorting aside for other virtual pastures. His most recent gems appear on his Tumblr research blog, from which he unleashes a continual stream of glitched-out, scrambled, and occasionally insectile code-based art.

::dispersedStrata_140829b

	As Proctor explained it, the instant feedback loop between coding and quick results was what hooked him—he now posts multiple code-based artworks per day. His process involves sitting in front of his laptop at night, opening up Processing IDE and Sublime Text, and sketching until things begin to take shape.

	Proctor sets his parameters in the Setup function, which runs once at the beginning of each sketch. From there, he updates and changes operations in Processing's Draw function, running the command continuously until Proctor stops sketching. After every change, he stops and restarts his sketches to get a sense of each change's overall effect. After setting his sketch sizes and frame rates, it's then a question of the kind of image he wants to make.

rgbrods_640

	From there, Proctor can loop the images on-screen, then establish rules to that change his images based on their properties. He might look at something like each point's brightness; if it's above a certain value, he'll set it to be the value of the point next to it, thus making the image change over time. Proctor also sets other values to change positioning and color until he gets the outcome he wants.

	“Sometimes I'll write the code from scratch, but a lot of times I'll pull chunks from older pieces and build around that,” Proctor tells The Creators Project, “Iterating on old ideas gives way to new ideas, and over time I've gathered snippets of code that I like, which I can draw on or recombine to get new effects.”

	“It's very much an evolutionary process, where the best ideas survive and are refined, with occasional mutations or leaps forward. That's reflected in the images, which visually, in addition to the behavior that generates them, are inspired by biology and the natural world,” he adds.

::neighbors_140830a

	Proctor's relationship to the natural world starts with the process of generating and recombining code. It continues into the visual outcomes, which are guided by the rules he establishes, but can branch and change in unexpected ways.

	“It's not as concrete as the evolutionary process used by something like Electric Sheep, since it's just me as an individual guiding it,” said Proctor, “but still, I'm selecting code based on the visual characteristics it produces and pruning it over time.”

neighbors_140902a

	His code-created images start out arranged according to specific formulas, the same way the leaves on a plant grow in certain patterns. Over time, each image grows more complex, its characteristics changing based on the forces of the rules applied to it, the same way a plant might stretch in the direction of the sun, or tilt away from the prevailing wind.

	“My goal is for the images to be visually pleasing in the same way—complex, but ordered according to regular patterns, and ideally, to encourage reflection on the patterns and complexity of life around the viewer,” Proctor explained.

	It's this interplay between organic and virtual that gives Proctor's work its mesmerizing power. It can be seen in works like //neighbors_140831b, with its digital moss-like motion lapse, or in //dispersedStrata_140829b, which resembles cellular growth replicated in a virtual realm. And that's just an extremely small sampling of Proctor's wondrous fusion of the real and virtual.

	Fiery liquid earth, toxic fumes, and steep, rocky walls—volcanoes are about as dangerous as nature gets. Filmmaker Sam Cossman couldn't care less, it seems, since he brought an entire film setup right up next to the burning lake of lava at the center of Marum Volcano, an active hot spot on Ambrym Island. Decked out in a full body heat-proof proximity suite in the Oceanic country of Vanuatu, Cossman captured towering geysers of molten rock from a vantage point no normal human could withstand for more than six seconds.

Diving Into an Active Volcano documents the journey down into the sizzling pit, as well as the rare lava footage—impossible to capture without top-of-the-line heat-proof equipment—Cossman ventured there for. His beautiful compositions, tight editing, and energizing score bring this latest addition to volcano videography one step further than previous documentation of the Marum Volcano captured by Explorer Geoff Mackley. Plus, you get to see one member of Cossman's party actually pick up a piece of smoldering lava. Talk about heat-seeking.

	In Iceland, another giant volcano called Bardarbunga has been erupting since Sunday with such force that it's visible from space—we'd love to see what a posse of camera-wielding daredevils could capture in there.

Today Xbox One invites the beloved block-building explorer game Minecraft onto its platform with open arms, marking its graduation to the world of next-gen gaming consoles. Promising ""even bigger vistas,"" as well as the ability to import previous work into the newer, higher-res cubic universe, Microsoft's expanded game can only be good news for creative Minecrafters, who have blown up the art world's news feeds this summer with some incredibly ambitious projects. 

Among other projects, we've seen countless games meticulously reproduced in Minecraft style, a series of ridiculously detailed floating islands, and a massive 5200 sq. km world called Aerna. This summer, one of the most ambitous Minecraft endeavors we heard about was the in-progress replication of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. 

The film is being painstakingly reconstructed by Minecraft sculptor Grahame Skeavington, also known as Paradise Decay. As of his last update, over 70 minutes of A New Hope have been blockified, putting our cubic heroes on the brink of confronting the first Death Star. Demonstrating the fruits of his labor, Skeavington has repurposed this footage into several tantalizing trailers and driven the Internet wild with anticipation of his uncanny remake.

With an ambiguous expected release date of, simply, ""2015,"" we couldn't wait for another taste of Skeavington's Minecraft galaxy far, far away, so we got the inside scoop on his artistic process, his progress thus far, and what it takes to take on a project of intergalactic ambition.



The Creators Project: What inspired this project, and how did it go from an idea to something your team started pursuing? 

Grahame Skeavington: First things first, I’m not a team as such—it’s mostly myself with a little help from my daughter who is battling cancer. Minecraft helps her take her mind off her daily health issues. A few years back I was looking for something new and epic to do to boost my YouTube profile. I have always been a big fan of Star Wars since my father (rest his soul) took me to the cinema to see Star Wars for the first time on my 14th birthday. We had pancakes, watched the movie, and I was blown away! It was one of my fondest childhood memories.

	A couple of years back, my daughter and I started to play Minecraft and I had the idea to re-create the famous ‘Death Star Trench Scene’. This went viral on YouTube getting around 400,000 views and of course this got me thinking about my next spoof ‘Star Wars’ project, so I made the famous scene from ‘Battle of Hoth’. Again this video went viral on YouTube getting another 400,000+ views. It seemed that I had found a niche and viewers were obviously interested in this kind of thing so I released 2 more projects. One was a spoof re-creation of the famous ‘Asteroid Chase’ and the second was my first ever Minecraft adventure map called ‘Rise of the Rebellion’. In Rise of the Rebllion, the player has to traverse the Death Star in search of 8 hidden rebel plans whilst fighting off Stormtroopers. Famous YouTubers ‘Yogscast’ did a ‘lets play’ series of my map and generated over 2,500,000 views! Around this time a well-known Minecraft Podcast by the name of ‘The Shaft’ started to feature my exploits. One of the shows host ‘Eric Fullerton’ joked during a live stream.... “...at this rate he will have created the whole movie.”

	I like a challenge so that’s what got me started on this project.



Can you explain the process of interpreting a live action sequence in Minecraft cubes, to those unfamiliar with the game and its remix capabilities?

	I have had to approach this project scene for scene, with each scene being a whole project on its own. Minecraft is a game about learning how to build, craft and build anything your imagination desires, but at its heart it’s very basic.

	This is probably the reason why it has become so popular and it’s a great learning tool.

	Blocks in Minecraft are not small, for example my ‘Millennium Falcon’ spaceship is only about 10 blocks in height, so as you can image it’s quite hard to get the thing to look right in the game. Building the sets and vehicles are another challlenge in itself. I spent around a year just building a lot the sets I needed for the film. The DeathStar Trench took around six months, another three months for the Sandcrawler and a couple of months to recreate ‘Tatooine’ just to name a few off the top of my head.

	As I said I went about this scene for scene, so a typical day would start with me watching the section of the movie I was to re-create. If the set/scene wasn’t built, it would take a day or two just to build the set.

	For example, at the start of the film you see C-3P0 and R2-D2 in the ‘CR-90 Corvette’ which is being chased and attacked by the Empire.

	A quick rundown of a scene would go like this:

	1. Watch the scene I’m going to recreate.

	2. Build all the interiors with blocks.

	3. Create the skins needed: Minecraft features computer controlled AI creatures called ‘testificates’. In the game these are basically villages that go around farming and doing other chores. I have had to create new skins for these, for each new scene. I used a program called ‘Paint Shop Pro’ to design ‘Star Wars’ themed skins, and I’ve have made around 88 custom skins so far.

	4. Make sure the sets look as close as possible to those in the film: Again this process requires me having to redesigne all the original Minecraft textures to look as close as possible to those in the original film. Another challenge as the textures are quite big and blocky to look at.



	5. Place my actors in the scene and hope for the best! I say hope for the best becuase I have no control over their actions. They are all controlled by the Games AI so for me it’s a matter of waiting for them to move/act in the directions I need to film each shot. This can take anywhere upto 8 hours just for a few seconds of film.

	6. Practice the camera angles and positions.

	7. Film the scene: Two seconds of usable footage could take me anywhere up to 8 hours just to get what I need. For example, there’s a ‘Detention Block’ scene in the original film where Han, Luke and Chewie find and rescue Princess Leia, there’s a lot of shooting and explosions. This whole scene lasts just two minutes, but took me a month to film.





How is the process for building an object in Minecraft different from building in traditional CGI?

	CGI allows an artist to create objects inside a computer using software based algorithms. In Minecraft, it’s more physical-based so you can’t just program an object into the game, you have to build it from the ground up. Also the ‘testificates’ don’t act and have no facial expressions, so I’m having to find physical ways to give them expressions, like looking at the ground to give them the emotion that they are sad, for example.



Do any Star Wars locales or scenes stand out in terms of their detail/perfection? For example, did you recreate the entire Death Star?

	To be honest the entire film so far stands out for me, but only becuase I know whats gone into it. It might not look much on the screen and its depth is something people will never see or comprehend, but thats something I’m very proud about.

	As for the Death Star, I haven’t built a full size Death Star—only a small one for distance shots PLUS the ‘Trench’ scene which took six months to build.

A couple of my favourite moments/achievements are:

	1. Recreating the ‘Chess Scene’ from the original film where Chewie, C-3P0 and R2-D2 are playing a space version of chess. I couldn’t make the aliens needed for the chess game, so instead I made a giant chess board and used original Minecraft creatures and monsters as the chess pieces.

	2. The ‘Cantina’ scene where Luke and ObiWan enter the bar in search of Han Solo. The bar patrons are a mixture of cameo’s featuring famous YouTubers like: Notch, The Yogscast, Jesse Cox, The Minecraft Crew, Rsmalec, 2 Girls 1 Minecraft, Dead Workers Party, Bebop Vox, Sea Nanners, and Seth Bling. I also thrown in some of the original alien skins for good measure and any Star Wars fan should instantly recognise them.

	Notch, who made the game is actually the bad guy in my movie who gets his arms chopped off—but don’t tell him!

	As for the whole project, looking back to when I started 3 years ago, I have noticed a big difference in how much better the film is getting. I seem to be out doing myself with each new scene.

	Ideally I would like to go back and re-do certain scenes but thats virtually impossible now, would take even longer, mess up my production process and if I kept doing this the film would never get finished. I’ll put it down to a learning process and part of its charm.



What were some surprising challenges you've faced while working on this project?

	In the bigger scale of things the whole project has been very daunting. Minecraft is so basic and simplified that I’ve had to come up with a whole host of new ideas and tricks to make certain scenes work. Like the ‘Chess Scene’ above for example. I am not using any modifications in the game and this was one of my MAIN goals to keep it all original and vanilla, as they say. For example in the film you might see a Star Destroyer heading towards the camera with a planet in the background. It would take months just to build one planet, so this is what I’ve had to do to get the same effect:

	In Minecraft you can collect pumpkins to farm and eat, but if you put one of these pumpkins on your head you get to see the world through a cut-out in its eyes and it’s a great effect. What I did was take the pumpkin head skin, copied one of the ‘ORIGINAL’ planet images from the film and made a new skin with it for the pumpkin head. Now when I put it on my head I get a static view of a planet in the background instead of the default ‘pumpkin eye view’. It’s then a simple matter of flying towards my Minecraft model/build of the Star Destroyer to recreate the scene from the original film.

What are some tips and tricks you've picked up throughout the project? Anything you can share for aspiring Minecraft art creators?

	I’ve picked up too many tips and tricks to mention. I discovered that when you first boot up and start the game all the ‘Testificates’ face North for a few seconds. (Not a lot of people know this) This is great for getting your testificates/actors to face the way you need them. Minecraft also has actual pictures in frames in the game and these are great for making customised buttons, consoles, windows and are great for additional effects. I also discovered that ‘testificates’ would jump around if you place a half-block under their feet. this is a good effect to emote the expression for ‘jumping for joy’.

	It’s all a discovery process and I would say to other artists that trial and error is the key. Just explore, try out your ideas and learn from the results. Thats how I’ve managed to try and keep sane.



Skeavington is planning to premiere Minecraft Star Wars: A New Hope in a first-of-its-kind Twitch livestream, after which it will be available for free on his website. The film will air with no sound in order to avoid copyright issues. In order to watch at full volume, you'll have to supply your own copy of A New Hope playing alongside Skeavington's Minecraft footage. We've already got our copy, dusted off and ready to go—just a year of waiting stands between us and the ultimate Minecraft experience.

ROYGBIV: A Pixar Supercut from Rishi Kaneria on Vimeo.

Known internationally for the deep emotional lives of the characters in their feature films, since everything from Toy Story to Monsters University is computer-generated, it stands to reason that CGI ""lighting"" at Pixar is just a matter of colored sliders and mouse-clicks. With one look at Rishi Kaneria's ROYGBIV: A Pixar Supercut, however, suggests that the cinematographic processes that go into creating Oscar-worthy animations is far more involved than the reflective chrome on the hoods of their titular Cars might suggest—Pixar just makes it look effortless. 

	Above, Rishi Kaneria's ROYGBIV: A Pixar Supercut explores the color spectrum, as seen through the lens of Pixar's award-winning animations. Starting at red and ending with violet, this is a rainbow of a supercut that brings each hue on the emotional spectrum to light, featuring footage from all 14 of Pixar's feature films.

	When drones aren't busy documenting extreme sports, exploring abstract virtual realities, or taking selfies, what do they do in their spare time? Based on Cyanide Run, the recent video collaboration between BayAreaCrasher and Hovership, it looks like they get down and dirty practicing drone parkour. Pulling off crazy-nimble aerial acrobatics, the two drone videographers maneuver their unmanned quadcopters at lightning-fast speeds through the graffiti-covered ruins of the American Flats cyanide plant in Storey County, Nevada. Showcasing a wealth of street art, from simple tags to ambiguous, possibly political statements, the sweeping shots display the soaring, immersive possibilities of drone videography.

	Not unlike the DIY Oculus Rift drone we covered back in April, BayAreaCrasher and Hovership have heightened their aeronautic experience by streaming their camera feed through a pair of video glasses. According to a comment on Reddit, the rig ran the duo about $400—not a bad price for a solid simulation of autonomous flight. Strap on a fan and some fake wings and they might even provide some competition to Birdly, the Oculus Rift bird-flight simulator.

Photos by Tim van de Velde

	Make no mistake: Incineration Line 6, a waste-to-energy incinerator/power plant in Roskilde, Denmark recently-completed by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, is a thing to be behold: spotted with laser-cut circles, its concealed, individually-controlled lights illuminate the umber-colored aluminum tower from the inside-out at night—a symbol for the combustion taking place within. 

	""I want to engage Incineration Line 6 in a dialogue with its historic and industrial surroundings. Close to the ground we shaped the building to reflect the angular factory roofs of the immediate surroundings,"" said van Egeraat, following his 2008 win of the international competition to design the structure. ""We then let the building culminate in a 100m tall spire. This spire pays the due respect to the existing historic landmark, Roskilde Cathedral, with its trademark twin spires and its warm brick and stone material palette.""

	It is, without a doubt, a beautiful piece of architecture, one destined to not only power and heat the surrounding region, potentially a future landmark in the low-lying Danish landscape. 



	While few doubt the promise of waste-to-energy programs (the country of Sweden is able to recycle 99% of its garbage through them), what makes Incineration Line 6 stand out is its commitment to beauty, despite the less-than-glamorous nature of its operations. The lighting itself—112 Martin Exterior 410 fixtures and 78 Tripix 1200 LED strips were installed, controlled by Martin's M-PC software—was custom made for the plant by Harman brand, Martin Professional. Explains van Egeraat, ""At night the backlit perforated facade transforms the incinerator into a gently glowing beacon – a symbol of the plant's energy production.

	""Several times an hour a spark of light will gradually grow into a burning flame that lights up the entire building. When the metaphorical fire ceases, the building falls back into a state of burning embers.""

	An emblem of the beauty found when form-meets-function, Danish waste management company Kara/Noveren soon may have one more type of clutter to deal with—tourists.

Kokofreakbean makes the kind of mind-frying videos that can take a while to recover from. Case in point is his newest music video for EPROM's track ""Center of the Sun."" The track itself is a glitchy wub of electronica and Koko's volatile visuals pulse and warp to the immersive beats.

	Koko describes his style as ""Bedazzled, funky fresh, spaghetti and meatball disco pixels with spiritual tendencies from Texas""—and if you're familair with his work, you'll know that's not a bad description. With ""Center of the Sun,"" there's no slow build up or ease-you-in introduction; you're just thrown right in at the deep end of techno-shamanic pixelated psychedelia and a whirling Olmec sun god.

	""The first minute of the video was heavily inspired by Alex Rutterford's video for Autechre's 'Gantz Graf,'"" Koko explains. From there it stargates into a medley of shifting CG-forms that look hard enough to conceive, let alone design. 



	""I ended up using a spreadsheet technique where I would isolate chunks of the song, translate those chunks into frame ranges, and describe the camera movement and visual content of each segment,"" Kokoa says about his process behind the video. ""Once I felt I had a decent chunk carved out, I would figure out how to execute the images using 3ds Max and After Effects. Because the song already had so many meaty, granular textures, images would almost immediately be conjured in my mind, so the conceptual stage was always the easiest."" 

	The spinning, spewing Olmec sun god features prominently in the video, as flashing shapes oscillate around him, giving the whole thing a cosmic quality. ""The title and tone of the song gave me these notions of a spiritual dimension or zone in a deep recess of space where energy collapses and reforms infinitely,"" the CGI artist explained. ""In most of my work, there is a reverence for spirituality and the role of the shaman in guiding and molding that spirituality. People always assume I get my ideas from heavy drug use, but I don't do drugs (except for the occasional pain reliever). I don't even drink.""



	It's merging these Mesoamerica myths and cultural totems with a glitchy, digital aesthetic that defines a lot of Koko's work and keeps you, the viewer, spellbound (albeit slightly alarmed). ""Imagining what the Mayans or Aztecs would do if they had access to 3ds Max or After Effects excites me immensely,"" he explains.

	""Many artists in the contemporary world seem to have a disdain for overt spirituality or mysticism in their work, but they're disregarding a crucial component of the human experience. I don't subscribe to a particular religious ideology, but I relish the pageantry and undeniable power of religious performance. Combining that vague religiosity with a quasi-modern form like glitch, which glorifies digital flaws, seems appropriate.""

	Dutch composer Kyteman, working in collaboration with a deaf 19-year-old named Vera van Dijk, has composed a song using only frequencies detectable by a cochlear implant—a device which allows the deaf to regain limited hearing capabilities. Van Dijk recently received one such implant, opening a whole realm of personal and professional possibilities to her, including the chance to participate in the specially-tailored concert.

	Throughout two trial-and-error studio sessions, Kyteman and his bandmates played music at varying frequencies and volumes, consulting van Dijk about whether or not she could hear them. Once they had gathered all the data, they wrote a cover of Sam Smith's ""Stay With Me"" using only the notes van Dijk had approved in their studio sessions. The result was a live concert performed for 400 people—the first that van Dijk could fully participate in.

	Her experience was further enhanced by a mobile videochat with her brother, whose lips she read in order to understand the song's lyrics. ""It was definitely a challenge to arrange the song for Vera,"" Kyteman told The Daily Mail. ""But when I saw her enjoying every moment during the concert, I knew it was mission accomplished.""

	Below are a few snapshots of the composition process, plus a short documentary about the project—skip to 5:07 to watch the full concert footage.

	""You won't hear a thing. You'll hear EVERYTHING,"" said avant garde legend John Cage about his Musicircus events—organized ""happenings"" where he'd gather as many musicians and artists as he could to simultaneously perform in the same space, then ask audience members to weave in and out of the cacophony. To celebrate what would be the experimental composer's 102nd birthday (he was born September 5th, 1912 and died in 1992), British performance center Aldeburgh Music and digital arts platform The Space have created an interactive online space where visitors can curate and remix their own Musicircus happenings. 

	Titled An Aldeburgh Musicircus, the project includes video footage from the 67th Aldeburgh Festival this past June, in which 1,000 performers simultaneously across the English coastal town for two hours. Unlike the real life event, though, the online project (developed by Avco) allows users to explore over 40 of the performances—from a man playing bagpipes on a roof, to a group of children playing violin—in one space, effectively offering the chance to traverse space and time with the added kick of a sensory overload. 

	As intended, navigating a Musicircus can be disorienting and overwhelming—online or IRL. We're not sure if this is how John Cage imagined the legacy of his experimental performance series, but it's certainly more entertaining than scrolling through a collection of silent performances—test it out for yourself here.

	While the compact simplicity of ""LOL"" might be easy on the eyes and fingertips, and even acceptable overheard rolling off someone's tongue, if you're sensorially inclined, chances MMS messaging is leaving your olfactory system out. Not anymore:

iScent is a Bluetooth-enabled atomizer which effectively turns ringtones into scented mist. Crafted in the form of an innocuously-shaped turreted tower, and accompanying app, this new Kickstarter project from smartphone-tech research and development company, Qblinks, aims to expand your immersion in social media by conquering the inside of your nose. Not only does the atomizer work with ""all kinds"" of liquefied smells and essential oils, it even has a ""Party Mode"" that disperses its mists to ambient sounds, including conversations and music:



Via Kickstarter:

In ancient China, the Wolf Tower was used mainly to alert soldiers of the danger of encroaching neighbors. Soldiers would burn the excreta of wolves to create a smoke signal atop the tower. Other towers would then be able to spot the smoke signal from afar, and then create their own smoke signal which would pass the message further along to the next tower, and so on. [...]

In the modern world, people use mobile phones to communicate. We are inundated with social media notifications. At the end of the day, those notifications are just like the smoke signals rising from the top of the Wolf Tower - messages.



	Available in grey, brown, and white, while iScent is only a fraction of the way into its $33,000 Kickstarter goal, the project still has 28 days to convince people what their noses already know: in a world of visual and haptic technological immersion, even common scents stand out. 

Head over to Kickstarter to learn more about iScent.

	If people across the entire Internet collaborated on a dress design, would it be threads worthy of Fashion Week? We're going to find out soon: Anouk Wipprecht—the futuristic clothing designer, known for her robotic spider leg dress and a 3D printed electric chain mail outfit—is inviting anyone with an ethernet cable to contribute towards creating the world's first open-source, 3D-printed dress. 

Titled the Open Source Element Dress, Wipprecht (alongside Austrian creative network, Polaire) has placed an open call for ""anyone who has a bit of inspiration"" to contribute 62 mm-wide design-elements called ""particles"" that will be united on the dress through a connecting mechanism. Using a TINKERCAD template, people can submit personalized particle designs, and 150 will make it into the final piece of clothing, to be completed by September 13th. So far, entries have taken the form of tentacled sea creatures, precious gemstones, and idiosyncratic geometric shapes. 

Wipprecht told The Creators Project that she's getting submissions from sources as diverse as 10-year-olds in the US to a new hackerspace in the Philippenes. In her eyes, this is what makes the open source dress so exciting—it brings together the creative sensibilities of hundreds of different people in a way that simply wasn't possible for pre-internet fashion designers:

""Why would we wait for that one awesome 3D printed dress that 'embodies the future' to be presented and pushed upon us to adore?"" she said. ""Why not all make that one dress that represents a possible future—not designed from the hand of one designer, but with the world.""





""This is exactly what we want,"" Wipprecht said over email—""to deepen the idea of 3D printing and design, seeing how things can connect more. I think one of the things that I find super interesting about 3D printing is that it brings a totally new social context with it...It's a very personal and intimate message, to finally be able to design a particle or a piece of jewellery, created by you with someone else in mind."" 

	To further this soulful take on the technology, the designer started collecting the stories that people sent along with their remixed particles, though the designs themselves are already uniquely human: ""You can really see a handwriting in each particle that gets sent to us. I am always worried that with 3D printing the emotions each design conveys gets lost somehow, and finally, by rituals, by adornments, by education, by showing skill, by experimenting, I see so much passion.""

Once the design process is complete, contributors can either print their particle out and send it to Wipprecht's and Polaire's collaborative studio in Vienna, or they can email her the digital object, which she can print herself. Wipprecht's own contriubution is an LED NeoPixel-infused particle that lights up with a swirling neon blue pattern—a challenge to the Internet-at-large to bring their 3D printing A-game.

	""What I think I want to say is that 3D printing should involve more emotion, more depth, more meaning, more personality. I haven't figured out yet what it exact is that triggers me to think that this project is steering something that can have potential to emotionize digital design. But there is an bigger and holistic idea behind it that I would love to explore more.""

	Below, watch a video that showcases Wipprecht's illuminating particle design, as well as some images of the particles submitted so far.

	To submit your own particle, follow the simple steps on Wipprecht's Instructables entry for the project. The completed dress will be unveiled on Sept. 13th, once all of the crowdsourced particles have been gathered.

	Sure, androids might dream of electric sheep, but when an unmanned aircraft soars over a city, what does it see? One new surreal simulation game wants players to imagine just that; part of the Barbican Digital Revolution Exhibition, Loop 60hz: City of Drones allows players to pilot virtual crafts through a generative geometric environment. A collaboration betweenexperimental music legend John Cale and speculative architect Liam Young, Loop 60hz: City of Drones charts ""the story of a lost drone drifting through an abstract cityscape,"" in which, ""players pilot a virtual craft to explore an infinite urban landscape."" 

Produced by the Barbican and co-commissioned by The Space, with the online project  developed in collaboration with digital artists FIELD—the Creators behind Energy Flow, which we made a documentary about, viewable here—it's part-ontological exploration into the ""inner lives"" of these seemingly thoughtless flying machines, part-experimental art-gaming experience, and all-immersive.

	From the website, ""Typically associated with militarized applications, each drone is repurposed here as both disembodied instrument and dynamic audio infrastructure."" Using original samples from soundscape compositions by Cale, juxtaposed against Young's cold, sleek architectures, the project is an effort in reimagining the oft-maligned aircraft technologies. 


		On September 12 and 13, Loop 60hz: Transmissions From The Drone Orchestra, Cale and Young's ""immersive live music and drone performance,"" will take center stage at the Barbican Theatre whilst City of Drones provides its online visual narrative.

""I've always seen faces in objects and textures since I was a child,"" says CGI artist, Lee Griggs. ""I believe it's called pareidolia. I guess I enjoy making faces out of other shapes."" While common examples of the described psychological phenomenon typically include seeing animals in the clouds or human features in pieces of fabric, Griggs sees and then digitally renders faces that are anything but part of the animal kingdom. 

	 

	From his abstract profiles that we described as trippy (albeit awesome) digital mutants to his portrait modeling experiments, the Madrid-based artist's work looks like an extremely realistic comic book character or psychedelic creatures that didn't make it into the final footage of Pan's Labryinth. 


Fittingly, he told The Creators Project, ""The area that interests me most about working with CGI is that you can make the unreal look real. It is this search to create something that hasn't been seen before (and which looks pretty) which drives me."" And to satisfy his creative itch, the artist has been releasing a slew of digital projects on his Behance page this summer that look so crisply designed, it's hard to believe his computer-generated characters aren't actually tangible entities. ""The aim is usually to make the CGI look like photoreal work, but it's all CGI,"" he said.

	 



	 

	Griggs once worked in a VFX studio, but explained that the high-stress conditions got to him, and he ultimately left the industry so he could have more time to explore his own ideas in CGI. ""My current job is to test the rendering software and to see how far I can push it. I like to see if I can break something by going beyond its intended use or mixing it with something else entirely different."" 

	 

	In his character profiles, the artist used a 3D scanned head created by a specialist named Lee Perry Smith. He simply took the model and applied various digital art techniques through rendering system Arnold for Maya. ""They are really just a bunch of software techniques that have been used in ways that they weren't originally intended for. Most of them are just happy accidents.""

	The interstellar stop-motion video for ""Après Avoir Décroché Les Étoiles"" (After Earning The Stars) by French outfit Ödland beautifully matches the track's theremin-enhanced cosmic vibes. Directed by the group's synth player, Lorenzo Papace, the four-minute short integrates a highly stylized live action sequence, where the band encounters a large, Soviet-looking spaceship before embarking on a space voyage filled with paper cut-outs and in-camera effects that would even make Michel Gondry proud.

	According to a Reddit post, the video was created while the group toured through the former USSR. Though we don't to assume the visit inspired Papace to think about fantastical escapes, the possible commentary isn't exactly subtle. Regardless, the throwback stylings throughout the whole video—from the music, to the costumes, to the stop-motion techniques—congeal into one epic, retro journey that we're ready to get on board with.

"|>>GENESIS 2014 Celebrates The Work Of Emerging Artists|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/genesis-2014-celebrates-the-work-of-emerging-artists|>>","|>>
New work from GENESIS' live graffiti artist PUSH, who was selected by AOE supporter Shepard Fairey. 

The Art of Elysium organization is an arts-and-community focused nonprofit founded by Jennifer Howell. On September 5, at the Ace Hotel, Los Angeles, they will hold a multi-platform art party and exhibition with the express goal of raising money for the charity through a curated celebration of emerging artists. 

Featuring live performances from SoKo, Moses Sumney, The Garden, Nite Jewel, and more, alongside fine art and film installations by Chris Milk, Lance Bangs, and street artist WRDSMTH, GENESIS 2014 aims to serve as a beacon for the constructive, community-building capacities of curation—each artist was hand-selected by a panel of artists including Spike Jonze, Alex Ebert (of Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros fame), Catpower, Jakob Dylan, Santigold, Shepard Fairey, Karen O, and Beck.  Rain Phoenix, the event's organizer, describes the creative torch passing as a ""circle of giving, a chain reaction."" 

Of his participation in GENESIS, emerging street artist WRDSMTH explains, ""Rain Phoenix discovered my art a few months ago and asked me if I wanted to be involved in GENESIS 2014. I jumped at the chance as I love everything that The Art of Elysium does. It is such an inspiring and thought-filled organization [...] which is one of the many reasons I said, 'Absolutely.'"" 

	SoKo echoed his thoughts, adding that this would be an intimate, familial event: ""I've known about Art Of Elysium through my friend Rain Phoenix for a while now, and I've always wanted to join her on her trips to hospitals and sing for kids with her. And then Alex Ebert, from Edward Sharpe, is an old friend and I'm also signed to his label, Community Music. He happens to be one of the curators of the night, and asked me to perform. So now this is the perfect combination of all the people I love in one single event.""

As the curation style of the show is unconventional, we reached out to Phoenix to talk art, collaboration, and the genesis of GENESIS.

The Creators Project: Can you describe the mission of Art of Elysium? 

Rain Phoenix: The Art of Elysium, founded in 1997, is a non-profit organization dedicated to enriching the lives of artists by providing them with opportunities to be of service in their communities. We currently serve medically fragile youth throughout Los Angeles and New York and are thrilled to be expanding our programming to various populations in need as we promote a model of healing through the arts within our community. And I’m super excited, because Elysium Sessions (our music devision) recently added eldercare facilities!

Why is it important to you to include both emerging and established artists in your overall mission?

	When an established artist highlights an emerging artist, it creates a circle of giving, a chain reaction. We as artists have a responsibility to give back in whatever capacity we can. We get media attention, we have microphones, we can use theses tools to broadcast a culture of kindness, one where competition takes a back seat to collaboration. 

	No matter how well known or obscure an artist is, when we volunteer for the sake of someone else’s well being, we are reminded of a deeper purpose. Service is the great equalizer.

Where did the idea for Genesis come from?

	This is the 6th annual Genesis event for The Art of Elysium, but when I came on board in February 2014 I set to work on a new concept: I’d been working on an artist launching platform with the focus on curation, as well as producing multi-platform collaborative shows… So, I was really happy when the charity’s founder Jennifer Howell supported me in combining these two ideas into one show. 

What inspired you to ask artists to curate their own show? 

	To me, if art comes recommended by an artist I respect, I’m more prone to check it out. And I love getting artists together from across mediums to collaborate - there are always surprises and almost always they are cool.

How do you hope GENESIS will inspire its artists, audience, and The Art Of Elysium's future projects?

	I hope Genesis will be the beginning of many new friendships, collaborations, inspiration and most of all, that collectively we will plug in to the power of service. The power we all have to turn apathy into action. To see first hand that our actions can create positive change in the world.

And any specific projects you want to highlight? 

	I want to highlight all the incredible artists who volunteered their time and talent, who’ve come together to make this night possible. This is the kind of show where words fall short - it really needs to be experienced! I encourage Angelenos to come and see for themselves this Friday. 

I also want to highlight some other kindred spirit non-profits. There are so many great organizations doing good work. I hope in the near future there can be more collaborations between us so we can tackle even bigger problems collectively and help to be a cause of more joy in the world:

	The River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding 

	The Lunchbox Fund 

	Aileen Getty Foundation 

	Creative Visions Foundation 

	Music Cares 

	Mario Batali Foundation 

	The Silverlake Conservatory of Music

	Pablove Foundation 

Street artist WRDSMTH collaborated with Alternative Apparel for this tee-shirt design. All proceeds to benefit The Art of Elysium.

"|>>Smoke Bubbles Carry Projection Mapped Messages Of Kids Talking To Aliens|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/smoke-bubbles-carry-projection-mapped-messages-of-kids-talking-to-aliens|>>","|>>


Barring universe-is-a-2D-hologram theories, there's a good chance that, out here, spinning silently in the vast emptiness of space, we're not alone. Be it intelligent life or single-celled organisms, the chances of making contact with alien life forms, while improbable, always remains a possibility. But if little green men were to show up on our doorsteps tomorrow, what would we say? One artist is probing these depths using two unconventional assets: bubbles and children. 

Floating Worlds is the brainchild of mixed-media artist Justin Dwyer. Part-imaginary narrative, part-projection mapping experience, in it, Dwyer illuminates smoke-filled bubbles with images of children asking questions to extraterrestrials. Explains Dwyer, ""Floating Worlds is an art performance where children recorded messages for Aliens who had appeared in the skies of Earth. These messages are projected onto smoke filled bubbles that float up to the Aliens and deliver their questions."" Though he doesn't note where the event was held, Dwyer's project certainly looks like the kind of class presentation that would have blown our elementary school minds. 

	In the video above, Dwyer explains that the bubbles needed to be smoke-filled in order for his Kinect-based rig to map them. Creating the backstory, however, was an exercise in imagination. ""The story is that aliens have appeared as large eyes over the Earth, and as humans, we've decided to send up bubbles with messages from children, as this would be a very friendly first contact."" Take that, McConaughey!





















So while I withhold every impulse to belt out Modest Mouse lyrics as I rewatch Floating Worlds, it's worth taking a minute to consider the question: if aliens visited the Earth tomorrow, what would you say?

"|>>Film's Not Dead (Yet): New Efforts Beckon A Return To Analog Photography|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/films-not-dead-yet-new-efforts-beckon-a-return-to-analog-photography|>>","|>>
	With the advent of digital cinema and photography technologies, and subsequent restructurings of celluloid production at Fujifilm, Kodak, and Polaroid, for years it seemed as if analog photography had all but gone the way of the buffalo. Sure, big-budget productions including Boardwalk Empire and Man of Steel still shot on 35mm (our Collaborators series on Daft Punk was shot on 16mm), but if Quentin Tarantino's pessimistic take on ""digital projection and DCP's"" was any indication, this would be a brave new world of (primarily digital) filmmaking. But the situation may not be as dire as the many ""film is dead"" prognostications suggest—while the Golden Age of silver nitrate may be gone for both still and motion photography, a number of new products and efforts just might keep celluloid alive and burning: 



	In crowdfunded documentary Out of Print, filmmaker Julia Marchese features interviews with Joe Dante, Kevin Smith, Rian Johnson, and Richard Kelly on the importance of the preservation and proliferation of 35mm film. Says Marchese, the creator of the Fight for 35mm petition, I don’t think as many people realize they have a choice, that they can voice their preferences to their local cinema and help their local theaters keep their 35mm projectors. But that’s kind of the goal of the film – to let people know that they do, indeed, have a choice."" Lucky for her, she's not alone in her sentiment. 

	Recently, it was announced that Kodak, in particular, is getting a lifeline from Tinseltown. Thanks to ""lobbyists"" including Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Judd Apatow, J.J. Abrams, and, of course, Tarantino, studios have agreed to ""buy a set quantity of film for the next several years,"" regardless of whether or not they decide to use it. Explains Weinstein Company co-chair Bob Weinstein, the deal is ""a financial commitment, no doubt about it. But I don't think we could look some of our filmmakers in the eyes if we didn't do it."" While its long-term future still remains uncertain, this move allows Kodak's legendary Rochester, NY film manufacturing plant to keep its doors open, at least for a while longer.



Ferrania Documentary by LUCE from FilmFerrania on Vimeo.

	Across the pond, in fact, one film manufacturing plant has announced their plans to reopen its doors to 35mm and 120mm still formats, as well as Super 8 and 16mm cine film production. In a countdown blog post entitled, ""The Countdown Begins,"" Italy's Film Ferrania presented a documentary filmed by legendary production company, LUCE Cinecittá, that shows their factory film production way back in in the 1940's. It's been a few years since Film Ferrania ended production for many of their celluloid products, and we have to say it's good to have them back.



	That's not the only big Super 8 news, either: combining techniques culled from both old and new camera technologies, a father-son team in Denmark has announced the Logmar S-8. The first new Super 8 camera to debut in decades, the sleek device boasts not only its own side-mounted LCD display, but audio recording with 48V phantom power, variable speed, and even timelapse support. While the beta line is already sold out, fret not: with even stars like Ben Affleck using Super 8 in Argo, you can bet your bottom dollar on a Logmar S-8 V.2. Check out some sample footage here.

	Unfortunately when it comes to instant film, the market has yet to experience its rebirth. Best depicted in Grant Hamilton's Time Zero: The Last Year of Polaroid Film, the loss of the click-and-flap photo format was bemoaned from casting couches to college dorm room walls everywhere. Now living on through The Impossible Project, Polaroid 600 cameras were recently introduced to their special edition ""Poisoned Paradise"" films, which offer a colorful alternative to the white-box borders of traditional instant film. Plus, this film features both three styles of emulsion (cyan, magenta and sepia), and the familiar comforts of an expiration date. 



	So for those of us considering the new 1-Hour Photo app to be one of few options when it comes to that ""old-school"" film feel, consider this your analog wake-up call. Film might be buried in the backyard, but if there's one thing the recent surge in zombie flicks has shown us, history loves a comeback.

	NASA is going to establish your social media brand in space. More specifically, the agency is crowdsourcing 50 tweets and 50 images from the public to be placed in a capsule and sent on a spacecraft aimed to land on the asteroid, Bennu. Though less dramatic, your Twitter presence could soon pull an Armageddon.

	The spaceship, titled Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx), is expected to intercept Bennu in 2019 when it will collect a sample from the 1,760-foot rock before returning to Earth in 2023. NASA explained in a press release, ""The mission also will contribute to NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) and support the agency's efforts to understand the population of potentially hazardous near-Earth objects and characterize those suitable for future asteroid exploration missions.""

OSIRIS-REx's principal investigator Dante Lauretta stated, ""I look forward to the public taking their best guess at what the next 10 years holds and then comparing their predictions with actual missions in development in 2023."" 

	Bruce Betts—the director of science and technology at The Planetary Society in Pasadena, California and a public outreach partner on the asteroid mission—agreed, adding, ""A time capsule capitalizes on the long duration of the mission to engage the public in thinking about space exploration -- where are we now, and where will we be."" The submissions will eventually be on view at AsteroidMission.org.

	This is the second time NASA attempted to get the public to participate in the OSIRIS-REx mission. In January, the agency asked the public to submit their names to be etched on a microchip aboard the spacecraft—though, clearly, having your witty Star Wars-related Tweets or #brunch photos sent up and above is a set up in terms of making your mark in the next frontier. The public can submit Tweets and images through September 30th by using the hashtag #AsteroidMission.

With Wes Anderson // Vehicles, supercut extrordinaire Jaume R. Lloret has added Wes Anderson to his repertoire of theme-based high-speed edits. From Steve Zissou's submarine to Mr. Fox's fantastic motorcycle, planes, trains, automobiles, and more have provided some of Anderson's quirkiest settings and set pieces throughout his 20-year career, and—as per usual—Lloret's cut beautifully lays the repetition of this stylistic choice out for the whole World Wide Web to see.

	The compilation highlights how consistently Anderson simulates the feeling of being inside vehicles, right beside the characters, these moments capture the emotional qualities intrinsic to each travel method—in Moonrise Kingdom, for example, the danger and uncertainty of running away from home is perfectly communicated through the POV shot of Sam's paddle boat floating through the reeds. Supercuts like this remind us why we fall in love with these films in the first place: We get to watch Owen Wilson pilot a helicopter into the sea, without any of the tears. 

	Below, take a look at some of the beautifully-framed shots Lloret gathered for Wes Anderson // Vehicles:

	The not-so-simple art of Pokemon design requires an incredible amount of creative talent—illustrating iconic creatures derivative of everything from woodland critters to mythical beasts to kitchen appliances (all within a complex elemental system and with a limited number of pixels to work with) is no easy task. With this in mind, graphic designer Jahn Johansen created an algorithm that dissects the mini-rainbow of individual colors that go into each Pokemon image, displaying them in convenient pie chart form.

	Some Pokemon, like Charizard, are understandably complex—it's a giant, fire-breathing dragon with green wings, it can have as many colors as it wants. However, as redditor /u/misogichan points out, Pokemon like the seemingly simple gelatinous blob Ditto, are also surprisingly detailed: Ditto is six different shades of purple. This phenomenon is also noted on blogs like Palette Town, which finds the most prominent three to five colors of their subjects and identifies their hexadecimal codes—a dream for aspiring Pokemon Masters who also dabble in graphic design.

	Johansen has helpfully published the Poke-Pie Chart crafting algorithm on GitHub, allowing you to create your own Pokemon pie charts if you have the proper coding tools. We hope no one will misguidedly use it to analyze the vastly inferior Digimon.

	Italian illustrator Federico Babina has previously united famous architecture and movie posters, buildings and bands, and even created an architecture alphabet. For his latest graphic design series, he's fusing iconic artists with architects who share similar styles or creative processes—even if not overtly apparent. 

Artistect includes 25 images that combines the characteristics of Keith Haring and Willem-Jan Neutelings, Kazimir Malevich and Zaha Hadid, René Magritte and Diller Scofidio, and other iconic creatives. Though the artists' overlapping styles may be extrapolated, Babina proves again that he's got a knack for finding kindred creative spirits in artists from disparate fields. Kandinsky and Wright make sense together—like an expressionist's pairing of ketchup and eggs.

	See some artist-architect fusions below, and head to Babina's site for more of his illustration syntheses.

	Night drives can take on a certain surreal quality as street lights and car headlamps whizz past you and blurr together, warping life into something with a dreamy glaze. 

	Playing on that sensation and abstracting it into the hallicinatory is director Hiroshi Kondo's film Eye Know, accompanied by by Ayako Taniguchi's urgent piano playing. It starts with a few establishing shots showing us the streetlights and office spaces, before upping the ante with some hyperlapse effects, hinting at the abstraction to come.

	Then it becomes a full-on kaleidoscopic madhouse of stimuli as the lights suddenly morph together and spark outwards into trailing intricate patterns like a firework display. It brings to mind the stargate trip in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

	Although Kondo no doubt used post-production CGI to create this wonderful short film, the next time you're a drowsy passenger in the back of a car, try squinting your eyes as you watch the lights go by and you might get a similar (if admittedly second rate) experience.

	For its seventh issue, the bi-annual arts and culture publication GARAGE Magazine is including a surprise on its cover. Still on the coattails of his Whitney Retrospective, Jeff Koons has created his first ever digital artwork for the front of the print edition, though you won't see it online. The piece, titled Lady Bug, is an augmented reality sculpture that can only be viewed on mobile devices through a GARAGE Magazine app, which allows viewers to explore the piece from a variety of angles as if standing on top of it. ""Now, anyone with the app can carry a Jeff Koons in their pocket,"" says a press release.

The magazine, which officially hits newsstands this Thursday, includes a variety of new media art, besides the virtual reality lady bug. There's an article on artist Halley Mellin about her 3D-printed canvases that she paints over and offers the files to the public, as well as an interview with new media scholar and video artist Hito Steyerl—plus other interactive app experiences like a virtual tour of Henri Mattise's studio in honor of the 60th anniversary of his death. 

	Michael Polsinelli, the editorial director of GARAGE, explained that the Koons collaboration was a seamless process. ""Our thoughts aligned very quickly,"" he told The Creators Project. ""We approached him with an idea to use this technology and suggested it could be fun to work on a cover sculpture. Jeff loved the idea and ran with it in a way that only Jeff Koons could.""

	Polsinelli added that even though the magazine has often focused on cutting-edge culture, ""It's true that it's never been so visible in our arts coverage as in this issue."" GARAGE will follow the app and new media-themed issue with an online website of its own. As for Koons' foray into more digital and virtual projects, the editorial director isn't so sure. ""It would be great to think so. We always hope that the conversations we have with such important artists are as interesting for them as they always are for us. Of course, Jeff Koons is an incredible artist who we could never lay claim to influencing…""

	To see Koons' Lady Bug, keep an eye out for the newest issue of GARAGE, out this Thursday on newsstands and available to order online here.

	Today, The Creators Project is premiering the music video for FaltyDL's ""New Haven,"" a single off the producer's fourth LP, In The Wild (out now via Ninja Tune). Directed by Kyle McDonald (who we previously featured here) and Blair Neal (previously), the video is as tricky as the song itself. Accidentally hit mute on your computer and you may miss a slurred riff that resembles the sound of a wind-up car being pulled back and shot across the floor with reckless abandon. Blink and you'll miss a shot taken via drone. Blink again and you might fail to notice that the video's lead actress keeps switching. As you look closer and listen in, the more things will begin to reveal themselves.

In the clip, a girl sleeps as visible breath emanates from her mouth like puffs of smoke, the visuals in time with the song's chopped up vocal samples. She jumps out of bed in a flurry and begins what may either be a jog, or a continuation of a dream in which she's running from an unknown force. The scene repeats itself three times, each iteration subtly changing an element or two of the sequence (including the addition of brief pulses of psychedelic colors) so the narrative maintains a shroud of mystique. 

To achieve this vague, ominous atmosphere, the directors implemented a variety of unique shooting techniques, including Lumia projection to create the shocks of color, a high speed camera to warp the narrative's sense of time, and Schlieren imaging to visualize the protagonist's possibly stressed breathing. The effects are understated but deft, together yielding an abstract by continuously curious video. The Creators Project talked with the team behind ""New Haven"" to discuss their camera techniques, as well as why it was extremely difficult to achieve the Schlieren effect on camera.






The Creators Project: The project description notes that video concept was based Schlieren imaging (and subsequently Lumia projections) — what about the song in specific inspired your chosen visual techniques?


Kyle McDonald and Blair Neal: The very visceral breathing samples throughout the song reminded us of this technique that is used for capturing minor variations in air temperature and pressure. The same way the song brings out the beat with breath and the voice, we wanted to visualize that.
			

You explained to us that as you experimented with Schlieren imaging, you found it difficult to reproduce the results on camera. What exactly went wrong?


			 

We underestimated the accuracy of the optical elements required to produce an effective large-scale Schlieren system: our pin light source wasn't enough of a pin light, our camera and light weren't colinear enough, the retroreflective screen didn't have a narrow enough return angle, the effect of ambient light on the retroreflective fabric was more significant than we imagined. We're convinced we could get the right effect with a large parabolic mirror but I'm not sure we could build a system that is both accurate, stable, and portable enough to get the shots we want. Definitely needs more research.


				 

				Unfortunately the more experimental techniques like Schlieren and Lumia don't lend themselves well to being photographed. The Lumia setup just looks like pointing a projector at a weird surface, the Schlieren doesn't make sense because it's basically a camera with a 200mm lens 25ft from a piece of draped fabric with someone holding a lighter halfway between the two.

				 




What shots were captured on the high speed edgertronic camera?


			 

			All the extremely slow motion shots right after the protagonist gets out of bed were captured with the Edgertronic camera, including the shots running down the stairs, face washing, teeth brushing.
			

How do you hope viewers respond to this video? Do you hope to trigger any sensations in particular?


			 

			We tried to create a sort of atmosphere of confusion and repetition at dawn/dusk, but beyond that some of the more experimental shots like the drone lift offs or the harsh editing in time with the music just pair well with the already visceral movement in the music.

MEMEX | Duologue, a collaboration between Marshmallow Laser Feast and Analog on Vimeo.

	The heads that make up London multimedia design studio Marshmallow Laser Feast (MLF) are no strangers to breaking conventions. The quadcopter-using creators of everything from 'Musical Laser Forests', to interactive light performances (featuring U2), to the visuals for Saatchi & Saatchi's 2014 New Directors Showcase, with ""MEMEX,"" their hyper-technical skill sets come to the forefront of their new music video for London-based five-piece band, Duologue. Explains MLF, ""MEMEX"" is, ""A 3D study of mortality exploring new photographic processes, in this case photogrammetry. In collaboration with Analog, FBFX and the band Duologue, this project is the beginning of a deeper study into filmmaking for the virtual reality environment.""







	Using FBFX's 94-camera real-time hi-res scanning rig, MLF created a 16k photorealistic full-body scan of model Beryl Nesbitt. Capturing her 360º 3D scan in 1/13,000th of a second, and combining it with a spherical panoramic HDR photo of a sunset (for realistic lighting) provided by Analog, Nesbitt was then recreated as a moving photo-scan that, in traditional MLF fashion, smashes traditional image forms. Says MLF, ""What's particularly exciting [...] about this project is that it's the beginning of a deeper study into photoreal real-time VR."" Simply put, it's a beautiful attempt at a live 1:1 recreation of flesh-and-blood in the digital format. 

	Below, see the down-to-the-pore recreation of model Beryl Nesbitt:









	Surely a fascinating introduction into what is sure to be a long and fruitful relationship between Marshmallow Laser Feast and the nascent medium of live 3D scanning, we can't wait to see what the studio comes up with next. Visit MLF's Flickr page for more behind-the-scenes images from the new music video for ""MEMEX"" by Duologue, and check out Marshmallow Laser Feast online for more conspicuous creativity.

	The next step in humanoid robotics is here, and it's named ACHIRES. Designed by the Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory, the ""Actively Coordinated High-Speed Image-Processing Running Experiment System"" takes advantage of modern video analysis programs to efficiently run on two feet without falling. Able to reach speeds over 2.5 miles per hour on its 14 centimeter legs, this bipedal bot even has the ability to kick a breakdance-esque back flip.



	Much like the cooperative robot swarm we covered last month, ACHIRES is a model that will be used to unlock the potential of its own form. Already more efficient than the ""computationally expensive ZMP-based control commonly used for balance,"" according to the video description, the current iteration's sensory observation system is can only bode well for the future of creative robotics. As cheaper and more efficient robots open the door to truly creative uses for them, if the Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory's first tests are any indication, it looks like the robot revolution is going to trudge forward on two feet.

frequencies (light quanta) from Nicolas Bernier on Vimeo.

Photo Credits: Nicolas Bernier + Daniel Romero

	Yesterday, Montreal-based sound artist, performer and composer Nicolas Bernier presented the third and last of frequencies, a series of artistic experimentations that focus on groundbreaking acoustic research at the crossroads between science, light, and sound-generating processes. Entitled frequencies (light quanta), the final piece in Bernier's project is a dynamic data visualization that blurs the boundaries among infinity, photon physical laws, electromagnetic forces, and cutting-edge audio-visual creative processes. 

	Consisting of a unique combination of a sonic micro-particle soundtrack playing alongside an auto-generative animation illuminated by hundreds of quantum physics-inspired visuals laser printed on acrylic panels, frequencies (light quanta) is a 3D audiovisual installation that allows viewers to explore the infinitesimal through a granular-synthesized physical space.

Crafted in about eight months of development and a few days of Bernier's residency at the Sound Lab of the LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial, in Gijon, Spain, we got in touch with creator Nicolas Bernier to get the inside scoop while he was putting the final touches on frequencies (light quanta):



The Creators Project: Can you start by telling us a bit about the evolution of frequencies series? How does frequencies (light quanta) differ from the other parts? 

Nicolas Bernier: The main aim behind the frequencies series is to work back to the basics of sounds—basic frequencies, mainly sines and white noise, but also basic sound generating processes. Those ideas dragged me into science, physics and into the history of acoustic researches (one must know that I am not a scientific mind at all, so I actually read these theories like poetry). 

	The first iteration, frequencies (a) was working around the acoustic sine waves of the tuning forks. The second iteration, frequencies (synthetic variations) was working with synthesize sound/physical matter as the core materials. This third of the series, frequencies (light quanta), offers a close-up on granular synthesis which deals with micro-sampling and resonance in regards to quantum physics theories of particles. 



Could you visually describe the piece? How do you intend to show it in a gallery and what experience does it offer to the public?

	The sound is bonded to a light composition that stems from a series of 100 acrylic panels standing on a black monolith. Each acrylic is engraved with quantum physics inspired graphics made of lines, dots and lines. These translucent panels will then form a moving animation as they're lit up. It is a bit like if I had the control over 100 cinema frames (so about 3 seconds of images at 30 frames per seconds).  

	The cool and important thing is that there is all sort of reflection effects going on depending on which panels is lit up. As there is a lot of randomness in the composition, it continuously creates new patterns combinations. It is endless, depending on the angle at which you look it at, so you can turn all around... it is infinity, which, again, relates to quantum physics and the infinite universe.



How about the technical aspect of the piece? What tools and technologies do you employ?

	First there is the support, a black monolith, which relies on really cool technology called carpentry. That said, the acrylic panels are engraved using a laser cutter and are independently lit up with 100 LED strips. All this work was made at Robocut studio, a really cool company that does all this stuff in Montréal. As the composition goes, the lights and the music signals are all sent from the same software, Ableton Live, using Max for Live for all the controls and the communication protocols. 

	Ableton outputs MIDI that is passed to Max for Live who send it to the MIDI/DMX-512 interface (all the LED’s are controlled with DMX-512, the standard protocol for stage lightening). Then a 4-dimmer pack converts the DMX-512 signal to voltage that goes straight to the LEDs. Those dimmer pack are my little tricks, they are super well done by a really small company in the US called Celestial Audio. 

How do you intend for this piece to evolve? And what about any future projects?

	I’ve worked 24/24 during the last weeks on this project so I think I will leave it for a bit and we’ll see where it will goes, but I already planned it so there could be several versions. Let’s see.

	Future projects: yes, tons! The only thing is that I need to find the money to make them and this is the long part! Oh, maybe just one advertisement to end on: the sound portion of the work will be released in October on the Italian minimal label Farmacia901.

	Labor day has passed, students are making their begruding migration back to school, and the days get shorter with every rotation on the Earth's axis: it's officially the end of summer. Filmmaker Mark Mazur created a short ode to the season's demise with AUGUST, the third in a series of films devoted to each month of the year's sunniest season. From close-ups of smoky campfires to action shots of football and tennis—expertly aided my Mazur's meticulous sound design—AUGUST captures everything we're going to miss about our laid back summer days.

	The good news is that we're primed for top notch sweater weather come fall, but whenever we miss these scorching—yet carefree—times, we can just pull up Mazur's shorts and reminisce whenever we want. Below, check out the first two summer shorts, JUNE and JULY, as well as some freeze frames from AUGUST guaranteed to thaw your frozen body once winter comes.

"|>>3D Dioramas Take 'Paper Mario' To Another Level|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/3d-dioramas-take-paper-mario-to-another-level|>>","|>>
Super Mario World by Diego Gallardo

	Old video games will forever have a place in the hearts and minds of those who grew up with them. Whether we'll see the current generation getting as misty-eyed for the Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto series as people do for the pixilated worlds of the SNES and its contemporaries remains to be seen.

	One thing's for sure, though: it'll be a lot more difficult to make 3D paper dioramas that recreate PS4 and Xbox One games than it is for 16-bit incarnations. Alain Wildgen (aka Wuppes), who hails from Luxemberg, collates and creates 3D dioramas from classic 8-bit and 16-bit video games, posting the work on his Tumblr. 

	The usual suspects are here—Mario, Zelda, Metroid, SF2—as artists take certain scenes or levels and replicate them into 3D form. In an article on Wildgen, Makezine described the typical process of turning a 2D image into a 3D diorama. It generally involves firstly finding the image you want—either from an emulator or a screenshot database like VGmaps—then uploading it into Gimp (an image editor) to modify it. Once you've finished with that, you print it out on paper, which you cut out and place onto pieces of foam with different depths depending on what elevation you need. And there you have it, an impromptu and cheapish birthday gift for the gamer in your life.

	There's a whole Facebook community dedicated to the art form, too—plus, Wildgen posts starter kits on his Tumblr, should you wish to try your hand at it. You can check out some of the diorama's from Wildgen's Tumblr, below.

	Roughly seven months ago, Radiohead released PolyFauna, an audio-visual experiment released as a free app that included sounds from the group's 2011 album The King Of Limbs. Today, the group updated the project with new music and visuals, including unreleased vocals from Thom Yorke, effectively making this Radiohead's first musical release in three years. Yorke teased the update over the past week, posting illustrations of PolyFauna on his shared Tumblr with Stanley Donwood, What Have You Done To My Face. 

	The interactive project was created in collaboration with digital art/design group Universal Everything, Nigel Godrich, and Donwood in an effort to give fans a ""chance to live inside the music,"" explained Matt Pyke of Universal Everything to The Creators Project in an interview. PolyFauna invites users to explore a mesmerizing world filled with patterned environments, lush soundscapes, and unique experiences for each user. 

""This became an atmospheric, fragmented memory of the track ""Bloom"" from King of Limbs,"" Pyke said. Now, PolyFauna is more than just a way to extend the experience of the band's last full-length, but a synesthetic opportunity to preview new material, and ""live inside"" sketches of what could be an upcoming Radiohead release. 

	In July, Johnny Greenwood told BBC 6 that they planned to rehearse and possibly record new material this month, and let's hope the app update signifies that they're following through with that plan. See some new paintings from Yorke's shared Tumblr below:

	Two heat guns stand on either side of a faded grand piano in the beginning of Laurin Döpfner's latest short film, Deconstucted Piano. Desconstruction, in this case, isn't an analysis of musical form or an artwork that highlights the tropes and cliches of its medium. It's the literal vaporization of the massive musical instrument, inch by inch, until there is no structure left—literal deconstruction.

	Shot in the form of a timelapse, Deconstucted Piano captures one frame of burning wood every six seconds, which creates the stunning impression of the piano almost melting into cinders in front of your eyes. The clincher in Döpfner's sizzling short is that one of the world's most celebrated classical piano pieces—Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata""—plays in the background, adding a haunting beauty to the fiery on-screen carnage.

	Here are some scorching stills from the piano's red-hot deconstruction—don't get too close or you might catch an ember.

	The lack of descriptions on the Spanish artist's Behance page only adds to the creatures' peculiarity.

This article originally appeared on our sister-site, Motherboard. Aramique, the creator in focus, has contributed to The Creators Project in the past, and we always love covering his awesome new media projects.

	When we last heard from interactive artist Aramique, he and Jeff Crouse, Gary Gunn,and Bartek Drozdz were debuting the Conductar app at Moogfest; there they let me take a spin in the virtual/augmented reality app's metaversian world inside the Oculus Rift. 

	Aramique, the interactive director at Tool, is now back with a new team, but this time he's debuting an installation called Heart Bot, which uses robotics and human heartbeats to make works of art. 

	After SMS Audio (created by Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson) and Intel collaborated to launch a new headphone built around a heart rate monitor, Aramique was brought in to create an idea for an installation that would appear at The New Museum in New York City. With partners Crouse, Matt Mets, Ranjit Bhatnagor, Adam Thabo, and Nikolay Saveliev, Aramique proposed a drawing machine that would be controlled by the heart rate of each viewer. 



	The idea was to create a collaborative piece of art that unfolded throughout the night by inviting all guests to spend thirty seconds with their finger touching a heart rate sensor, while the robotic machine would draw on the wall in real time. By the end of the night, as Aramique told me, they would collectively—humans and machine—create a piece of art together. 

	""Heart Bot consists of a pulse sensor embedded into a small pedestal, a wall with two stepper motors mounted 12 feet high and 10 feet apart, and a long belt stretched between them,"" Aramique explained. ""Attached to the belt in the middle is a rectangular frame fitted with two pen-wielding robotic arms that can draw through the window in the middle of the frame.""

	The user places a finger on the pulse sensor, then presses a button on the pedestal to begin the robotic process. The pulse information is fed to a small piece of software that sends a mixture of choreographed actions and pulse information to the motors and the robotic arms. By adding or taking up slack in the belt, the motors can move the robotic arms anywhere on the wall.

	As the motors drag, Crouse explained, the robotic arms move around the wall in large, slower motions, then twitch up and down and left and right to make smaller, faster motions. It all results in large-scale generative wall drawings that Aramique said drew inspiration from Sol Lewitt's conceptual minimalism—simple but strikingly geometric and fluid lines—but in a collaborative way. 



	""The process takes about thirty seconds per person, and after dozens of people have used it, the result is a collective representation of the emotional state of all of the contributors,"" said Heart Bot's technical director Crouse. Ultimately, 60 people participated by controlling the drawing machine with their heart rate, including 50 Cent and Carmelo Anthony. 

	According to Bhatnagar, an engineer at Tool, the two big inspirations for Heart Bot were Jürg Lehni's HEKTOR, which wasn't the first suspended drawing, but a successful one that brought the idea into the public consciousness. The other is Johannes ""joo"" Heberlein's PLOTCLOCK, which Bhatnagar described as a ""simple, clever, and nimble little drawing robot."" Joo made all PLOTCLOCK's plans open-source, allowing Heart Bot creators to remix and mash up HEKTOR and PLOTCLOCK for their own drawing machine. 

	""The challenge with the design was keeping it generative, controlled by the heart rate and creating some kind of order so it wouldn't become a mess of EKG lines,"" Aramique said. ""We decided on a radial design inspired by the hands on a clock and started each person's contribution from the center of the circle working its way out. Each of the 60 people add their hear rate drawing to what corresponds with a second or minute on a clock dial."" 

	After its one-night only appearance at The New Museum, Heart Bot made a trip across the country to Intel's San Francisco's facilities. There are tentative plans for it to be shown again at the Computer Electronics Show, but details for that exhibition are still forthcoming. The final work created by Heart Bot will be donated to Feeding America®, a domestic hunger relief charity.

"|>>This Is How 4D Gaming Actually Works|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/this-is-how-4d-gaming-actually-works|>>","|>>


	Indie game developer Marc ten Bosch boggled out minds in May with his four-dimensional puzzle adventure Meigakure, which forces you to 'walk through walls' in the fourth dimension to beat the game. Now he has come to the rescue with a fresh explanation of the complex in-game physics.

	First things first, it's important to remember that in the game world, the fourth dimension doesn't mean ""time."" Rather, it's a mathematical construct, similar to the relationship between the second and third dimensions. Where the second dimension has an x-axis and a y-axis, and the third dimension has x-, y-, and z-axes, the fourth dimension has an x-, y-, and z-axis—plus another entirely separate plane of existence.

	Bosch explains this concept by alternating between 3D animated footage from Meigekure and a classic 8-bit style animation, which acts as a 2D metaphor for the process of entering the fourth dimension within the game:

	First, you're on the wrong side of a wall. You can't jump over it and you can't go around it—not in the third dimension, anyway.





	Then, you enter the extra dimension not normally available—in the 8-bit world that's the third dimension, but in Meigakure it's the fourth. Here's where you sidestep the wall.





	Now you can easily get to the other side of the wall, but you're on a parallel plane, still separated from the damsel in distress. You can't see her because she's in the parallel, third dimension:





	Time to go back into the extra dimension—you're so close!





	A final jump gets you successfully to the other side of the wall. And that's how you walk through walls with the power of the fourth dimension.





	As Bosch explains in the video's description, this is actually walking around walls, not walking through them, but once gamers get the technique down, it's effectually the same thing. ""From the perspective of a regular 3D observer standing next to the wall, the player character would suddenly disappear, and a few moments later reappear on the other side of the wall,"" he writes.

	Until Bosch released this helpful explanation, the only other piece of video literature that dealt with the subject was a 100 minute-long animated adaptation of Edwin Abbott's novella Flatland. Now that Bosch has officially explained how he mathematically constructed Meigekure, the 21st century public is ready to understand his impossible game.

	While there's still no official release date, Bosch told The Creators Project, they are getting closer to completion every day. Based on what we see in this explanation/demo, as soon as the game is out, most of our free time will be spent in the fourth dimension, too.

	A team of artists at the Brazilian Estudio Guto Requena are using 3D printing to physically manifest the brainwaves that represent human emotion. Spearheaded by architect and studio founder Guto Requena, The Love Project uses portable scanners to measure said brainwaves—as well as heartbeats and voice fluctuations—while a subject speaks about a person that he or she cares deeply, and subsequently turns that data into house decorations.

	As demostrated in the video above, software developed by the D3 studio interprets each set of data as a layer in a 3D object, which can then be printed in the form of a fruit bowl, a lampshade, or another abstract shape. Every bump, wave, and ridge on the structure represents a moment of sharp emotion—even if you can't tell which bump means which feeling, the opportunity to physically handle an abstract concept is fascinating (Plato must be rolling over in his grave). 



Regarding the goals of The Love Project, Estudio Gut Requeno writes, ""The project suggests a future in which unique products will bear personal histories in ways that encourage long life cycles, thus inherently combining deeply meaningful works with sustainable design."" 

Widespread use of these objects is a possibility, too, as Estudio Guto Requena is planning two more stages for The Love Project.  The first is an in-development smartphone app, designed to allow users to create their own brainwave art and print themselves. The second is a series of lessons that will teach tomorrow's 3D printing artists about how to use the burgeoning technology. Talk about spreading the 3D printed love.

Dislocation of place and identity across space and time might be the operating order of our modern world. Technological effects—high velocity travel, instantaneous Internet, media-defined identities, and so on—create multiples of billions of worlds, where we never quite know who we are, where we're located, or where we're heading. 

	Within this milieu, New York City-based artist Marie-Dolma Chophel is out there mapping this highly fragmented, abstracted, and always in flux territory. As Chophel will tell you, it has a little to do with being born out of the “interbreeding” between French and Tibetan parents. Identity within space-time interested her from a very early age. And so Chophel's painted landscapes have the look of static 3D-rendered images. Grids, or “nets” and “suspended skeletons” as she variously calls them, unfold and recede along vast imaginary distances.



Untitled. Image: Marie-Dolma Chophel

To create some of her most recent paintings's nets, Chophel uses computer software to create her 3D grids, then painstakingly transfers them line by line onto canvas or inked paper with a projector.

In Melting, Chophel imagines a grid of mountains succumbing to some entropic disintegration, all set against an impossibly surreal atmosphere. Untitled features a Tron-esque grid mapped horizontally, receding toward a vanishing point, upon which snowcapped mountains sit like massive pieces on a chess board.

	“The motifs I use depict spaces without geographic reference—chronicles of imaginary lands inspired by topography, ancient cartography, Asian estamp and landscape painting,” Chophel writes on her website. “My first impulse was to develop a language of forms that could communicate the feeling of a different dimension of space-time, thinking the world as a constellation of related forms, places, ideas and people.”



Melting. Image: Marie-Dolma Chophel

	“Today we know the surface of a world that has already been entirely mapped out and pictured, and we can cross it in few hours,” she adds. “But it stays intangible as traveling is not truly 'knowing' the world but experiencing it as a simulacrum.”

	As Chophel reminds us, the world we see on our mobile devices, on Google Maps, in the cinema, or on the manifold vistas of the Internet—none of it's real. Like Disney World, with these new digital territories, we try to replace our own realities. Chophel, for her part, is trying to make sense of our increasingly simulated world and, ironically, adding more facets to it in the process. She is, like a science fiction author, a world builder.

"|>>Does Instagram's New Hyperlapse App Live Up To The Hype? We Asked Some Pros To Weigh In|>>","|>>http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/does-instagrams-new-hyperlapse-app-live-up-to-the-hype-we-asked-some-pros-to-weigh-in|>>","|>>


Image via

	On Tuesday Instagram released Hyperlapse from Instagram, an app designed to replicate the tricky process of capturing hyper-fast, ultra-smooth timelapse videos. Featuring ""built-in stabilization technology that lets you create moving, handheld timelapses that result in a cinematic look, quality and feel—a feat that has previously only been possible with expensive equipment,"" the company explained in a blog post, it seemed set to revolutionize this nascent niche hybrid of timelapse videography.

	The Internet, in turn, has raised a collective ruckus over the app, with publications going so far as to state, ""What was once only possible with a Steadicam or a $15,000 tracking rig is now possible on your iPhone, for free,"" and that Hyperlapse yields ""timelapse videos that look as if they're shot by Scorsese or Michael Mann."" Other sites have already begun to compile the best Hyperlapse uploads since the app's initial debut. Soon enough, it seems, we won't be surprised to find our feeds filled with time-warped test footage of morning commutes, sunsets, meals (from preparation through presentation), and (of course) pets. 

	If Vine and Instagram Video have taught us anything, savvy users will inevitably wield the tool for the kind of creative DIY filmmaking seemingly predestined for virality. At the same time, though, can a technique that videographers spend years mastering and build entire careers around simply be circumnavigated by way of the smartphone? We talked to some hyperlapse experts to find out what they think of Hyperlapse for Instagram. 





Paul Richardson, a filmmaker whose hyperlapse down the Champs Élysées wowed the web a few weeks back, explained to The Creators Project how the traditional hyperlapses is made. ""The basic method of a hyperlapse is to take a photo of a subject, move the camera, then repeat both steps a few hundred times. You have to make sure that every image is level and pointing at the exact same spot, so if you mess up one photo during a sequence you have to start all over again. Each movement between shots has to be the same distance, otherwise the final shot won't be smooth."" Feasibly, if Hyperlapse could create high-quality footage, it would save hours of meticulous tinkering. 

	For comparison, though, it's important to understand what the ""$15,000"" price tag in bells and whistles does for hyperlapse filmmakers. ""If you're using professional gear, you have the control to tweak every little detail to your liking,"" Richardson explained. ""And that's important in high-quality work, every single thing has to be right."" He continued, ""The professional gear would produce technically perfect shots, smooth pans, consistent frame, and enough detail to be displayed on IMAX screens."" 

Rob Whitworth—the 'flow-motion' timelapser who has captured the essence of cities as diverse as Barcelona, Spain and Pyongyang, North Korea—agreed that the equipment is essential for achieving gorgeous videos that truly drop jaws. ""For me, the magic of hyperlapse is the quality of the D-SLR Raw file, super sharp and amazing dynamic range mixed with an impossible camera moves. Super smooth motion in a straight line.""

	Even still, the videos we've seen from Hyperlapse genuinely look great, so where does the app fall short? 



	To start, Whitworth wouldn't even call the app-made videos proper hyperlapses. ""Essentially it's an amazing steadicam app,"" he told us. ""Steady, yes—hyperlapse, no. But it is amazing. 'Hyperlapse-quality clip' is pretty loose. A quick search on Vimeo will reveal a lot of existing hyperlapses might fall below that standard. I guess if the question is: Can I now throw away my camera kit and use my iPhone and this app? The answer is sadly not.""

Jonas Ginter, best known for his 360° little planet timelapses, pointed out other issues, primarily in the app's shortcomings: ""There is no wide angle, just low resolution, no dynamic range and so on. Footage shot with professional equipment would have more resolution, better dynamic range, more sharpness, more possibilities of different lenses… So, at the moment, it is like using a really nice steadicam or gimbal system and mounting a toy cam on it."" Ultimately, these qualms relate to the smartphone's lens, so maybe Hyperlapse could be become a game changer as companies continue to beef up their products' camera quality.

	These seasoned timelapsers, however, have already found uses for the app that don't involve directly replacing their professional camera rigs. Much in the same way that 3D printing has exponentially sped up certain pre-production processes in manufacturing, the Instagram app can act as a rapid prototyping system for hyperlapse shots. ""I will definitely use it when I plan my next hyperlapse sequences,"" said Ginter. ""I think it is a nice tool for pre shoots. With the app you can get a quick impression of what a hyperlapse could look like.""



For professional hyperlapsers, the app could become a useful, external toolbox—but it still has amazing functionality for the public at large. Thomas O'Brien, a filmmaker who specializes in starry-skied nature timelapses, agrees, adding, ""I have found when you give easy to use tools to people with no experience, amazing things can happen. When tools are made available to the masses to create art that was previously only available to professionals it benefits the art form in so many ways.""

In its current state, the app promises the ability to change the scope of the hyperlapse, and the chance to expand the art form in the same way that the hyperlapse evolved from the timelapse. On the smartphone, it could become a playground for new kinds of experimentation. However, Whitworth envisions a near future in which this technology can be widely used by professionals and amateurs alike— so long as it's attached to a powerful enough lens.


		""This must happen,"" he says. ""Nikon or Canon must be watching this. Somebody needs to add a computer to a DSLR so you can use a high quality sensor and great glass, and also get the advantages of an innovation like this. It's crazy these guys are still making essentially the same camera system as 60 years ago."" 


	 

	But is Hyperlapse the smartphone-enabled revolution it purports to be? Decides Richardson, ""It's definitely a big improvement on [past homemade] footage, but I think its uses past web-video will be limited."" The experts may agree this new tool is no substitute for the real thing, but then again, isn't that what we always say when technology tries to shortcut doing things the hard way?

Most people would probably agree that a rollercoaster with a 105-foot-tall vertical loop doesn't need any added thrills. Our nerves can only handle so much, after all. But the guys at VR Coaster think differently, and decided to up the adrenaline ante by bringing Oculus Rift into an amusement park. 

	Thomas Wagner, a professor in the Virtual Design department at the University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, wanted to merge virtual reality with a thrill ride, and subsequently approached German rollercoaster manufacturer Mack Rides to collaborate. They ended up creating a VR rollercoaster experience where the Rift is synced to the ups and downs and loops of the Blue Fire and Pegasus coasters in Europa-Park, Germany. As riders enjoy the blood pressure-raising kinetics, they are treated to visuals of an asteroid field, or whizz along on a flying coach across a fantasy landscape populated by dragons. 

VR Coaster will continue to test their ""augmented thrill rides"" and further develop the technology in hopes of eventually bringing it to other parks and countries. The video shows the test subjects holding laptops and game controllers while mid-ride—so, presumably, this project has a ways to go before all the kinks are worked out. Regardless, we're getting vertigo just thinking about what Kingda Ka would be feel like with the added sensory kick of Rift. 

You can check out riders' reactions in the video above and find out what insights the group made about the mechanics of rollcercoasters and VR over on their website. And below you can see the VR version of the Pegasus track.

DESIGNER SPORTS TECH OF THE WEEK



	Marking a major breakthrough for wearable tech in mainstream fashion, Ralph Lauren isn’t gonna be messing around at the upcoming US Open, having revealed a new Polo Tech shirt with smart capabilities. Athletes will get the chance to show off the garm, which takes the form of a fitted compression nylon shirt complete with enlarged RL polo player placements and biometric tech components by OMSignal. Using built-in sensors, the tee will track data like calories burned, stress levels, steps taken and heart rate, which can then be displayed on a smartphone or tablet app via a Bluetooth transmitter. Looks cool, acts cool, love it – my only gripe is, where are the women’s styles?

SMART-STYLISH ACCESSORY OF THE WEEK



	If you’re someone who’s constantly left stranded/angry/bored because your phone’s run out of battery AGAIN – the QBracelet might well be the best thing you’ve seen since sliced bread. Or something tech equivalent. Anyway, while this bracelet might look like a simple piece of jewelry, it’s actually a portable USB charger, compatible with iPhone, Android and Windows phones. The internal battery can charge your device up to 60%, and lasts for 30 days in standby mode. Gotta love that minimal design too – once it starts shipping in December, you’ll be able to get one in black, silver or gold.

BEAUTY-THEMED SELFIE TECH OF THE WEEK



	If you’re one for taking selfies, why not do it in style? In Shanghai and Hong Kong, word is that Sony has recently developed a sleek new camera shaped like a perfume bottle, complete with real Swarovski crystals. The design of the Sony KW1 allows users to take selfies easily, complete with a 180-degrees rotating lens head and timer mode, while the 19.2 megapixel sensor delivers ultra-sharp images. The device also comes with built-in Wi-Fi, so you can share your selfies as soon as you snap them.

SOCIAL MEDIA STYLE ANALYSIS OF THE WEEK



	Following the recent outcry against Soundcloud implementing ads, it looks like Tumblr is set to be the next social networking site to stir up controversy. Sorry guys, it’s no longer a safe haven for you and all your questionable pics – the microblogging platform has just launched a new initiative with photo-analysis specialists Ditto Labs, which can scan outfits in photos to identify what users are wearing, before passing on that data to brands and advertisers. Tumblr has claimed that the information will just be used to help companies better understand their image on the site, rather than adding any actual ads just yet. Realistically, this change to the platform will have brands asking why so many model-y kids have green hair (Hey, get it? I'm from 2011). 

SPACE-INSPIRED ACCESSORY OF THE WEEK



Getting a lot of love on Kickstarter right now (having smashed their $20,000 goal with over two weeks left to go), the Tessel Supply accessories brand has devised a new style of backpack inspired by space exploration. The Anti-Gravity Pack has been designed with a magnetic modular system, allowing users to customize the shape to suit with removable components. The silhouette can be broken down into the Fuel Cell, a tech accessories bag, the laptop-shaped Lander and the attachable Rover pencil case.

This article originally appeared on our sister-site, Motherboard, by frequent The Creators Project contributor, DJ Pangburn. We love Motherboard, and DJ loves Hieronymus Bosch (see below). 

	If you've never visualized dystopia, just look around. Visit a mega farm in California, a body of water near an industrial plant, or simply walk around Manhattan and let the rapidly evolving island for the rich, jet-setting class seep into your consciousness.

	If that doesn't do the trick, San Francisco-based artist Michael Kerbow is here to take you on a tour of today's dystopian milieu, and then extrapolate it all into a techno-induced future.

	Take Kerbow's Portents series. It's a dark and mesmerizing window into humanity's near and distant futures. On a thematic level, it deals variously with climate change, pollution, over-population, and humanity's Icarus and Tower of Babel-like drive to create new technologies; all toward perhaps some undefined and maybe even non-existent dream. 

	It's the sort of work that science fiction fans dig, that would keep Al Gore up at night (for good reason), and forces skeptics into paroxysms of climate change denial.

Their Refinement of the Decline. Image: Michael Kerbow

	In Gyre, a nod perhaps to the Pacific Trash Vortex, cars spin in a gigantic whirlpool. Kerbow's pencil and paper work on A New Religion resembles the recently-passed H.R. Giger, with monotone, industrial grays that depict some sort of a factory or plant growing heavenward. 

	And with Diminishing Returns, an endless city surrounds a circular sink hole, conveying the idea that as distant as our urban environments and populations might grow, some entropic counterforce always exerts a pressure on that expansion.

	Other times, like in his Consumption series, Kerbow creates surreal depictions of humanity's unparalleled capacity to consume biological life for food. His most recent series, the hyper-imaginative Aberrations, is surreal in a way that calls to mind the darkly apocalyptic work of 15th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. 

Diminishing Returns. Image: Michael Kerbow

	And then there's the Hollow Pursuits series, which envisions humans having exploited and developed every bit of land to build skyscrapers and freeways, with the last frontier of development being subterranean Earth. 

	By the looks of Diminishing Returns (above), it seems as though Earth's core is overheating, but that could just be the electric glow of one huge planetary city. What's also interesting here is that Kerbow flips the hollow Earth theory on its head: humans, not some magical force, are hollowing out the planet. 

	Kerbow's a bit less convincing as a visionary dystopian when he fixates on freeways and piles of unused cars. Even so, these paintings—Churn, Hive, and Compulsive Actions—are still a wonder to look at, and certainly worthy as satirical commentary.

Which is all to say, one can only hope Kerbow is proven wrong.

	British director Edgar Wright is a master at adding perfectly-timed humor into his films through a combination of impeccable casting, sharp cinematography, and crisp editing. With Monty Python-esque glee, his films call attention to mundane acts like drinking beer, drinking mixed drinks, drinking shots, and cooking bacon through dynamic close-up shots that drive home the silliness of these actions with seemingly effortless expertise. 

	Editor and filmmaker Jaume R. Lloret compiled some of the greatest close ups and slam zooms from four of Wright's most popular films: Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and The World's End. Lloret's supercut successfully triggers that slight dopamine rush you get from a well-executed extreme close up, and it's only amplified as the shots get faster and funnier. By the end of the 90-second compilation we were giggling at our desks with no control over our own diaphragms—just like actually watching any Edgar Wright film.

	See if you can identify which movie each shot comes from—here's one freebee: the shot where Michael Cera's hand signs ""Scott Pilgrim"" for a package is from (surprise) Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. For the rest, you're on your own.

This article was originally translated from The Creators Project Mexico. Images courtesy of the artist.

	A few weeks ago, Chilean Jon Jacobsen captivated us with Present, his animated photography series. An introspective work which reflects the ways in which we perceive our own senses, Jacobsen is back at it again with his first solo exhibition, Maps.

	Inspired by childhood memories and the ephemeral nature of time, Maps consists of eleven digitally manipulated portraits, a series of surreal images that reflect the artist's past relationships with each of the subject in the portraits. With a resultant dialogue that exists between the photographs and the present, it becomes apparent that Jacobsen is concerned with the interplay between individuals and experiences over time. 

On the work of Jacobsen, art historian Bernadette Mandiola notes:

Jon Jacobsen is an observer of humanity. He look, photographs, digitizes, re-photographs, and through that art, succeeds in showing his gifts as an artist and keen observer. Since his beginnings in photography, he has worked on the subject of the portrait, always of participants isolated in a time and a story. A story that audiences of his work imagine themselves in and add to their own personal memories...

Jacobsen's work references a Surrealist aesthetic, but is far from Surrealist; rather, it is a personal work of the mind and feelings, and how he perceives the sitter. This is seen particularly in his self-portraits in different periods of his life, which reflect different emotional states. The same happens in Maps, and here Jacobsen portrays people who have some kind of personal connection. 



	While, given the images present in the exhibition, ""Maps"" may seem like a disconnected title, Jacobsen explains he chose the name to reflect a process of ""mapping the feelings and wishes of the sitters."" Adding digital manipulation processes to reveal what is beyond the original photograph, Jacobson explains, ""The color, the textures, are endless possibilities to transform mixed with a traditional approach to photography. The tension between the real and the imaginary generates my interest in further exploring the digital format."" 

	Despite this, it is important to note that the work of Jacobsen isn't just about digital manipulation, because his compositions feature glimpses of historical portrait techniques that allude to the Renaissance and the Baroque; in short, both technical and aesthetic dialogues between past and present make the work of this artist so special. 

	Says Jacobsen, ""Maps is an invitation to see the self-portrait from another perspective. Each image shows somebody I grew up with. What they taught me, what happened before my birth, and my personal experiences all influenced the person I am today. These works interpret the invisible fabric that unites us in a temporary space, and form the basis of the roads that guide my work.""


		Below, more images from Jon Jacobsen's new exhibition, Maps:










Maps opened on Thursday, August 21 and will be available to the public from August 22 to September 4 at Sientoxciento Gallery, located at 1286 Girardi, Barrio Italia, Santiago, Chile. To schedule an appointment to visit, email sientoxciento@yahoo.cl

One Flew Over Iceland literally opens above an ice-strewn shore, sunlight dancing across both the rippling ocean and the shards of frozen water. As the quadcopter-mounted camera in Igor Byrko's drone's-eye-view short film smoothly tilts and pans its way over similarly frozen plains, mountains, and structures man-made and natural, the audiences are treated to frosty travels through the island nation.

	In the short, the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik, the Jokulsa Bridge, and the Vatnajökull Glacier all make appearances, demonstrating the graceful aesthetics both organic and artificial structures develop under harsh climes. Byrko also tunes his gravity-defying lens to the Russian city of Kalyazin, documenting landmarks like the Flooded Belfry, as well as local bridges and churches. With his capacity for controlling a quadcopter in even the coldest locations, Byrko is quickly becoming a pro at demonstrating their allure from on high. But we have to admit, our favorite part? Enjoying the wintry spectacle from the comforts of the summer sun— no mittens necessary.

	Should it surprise anyone that Miranda July—the Queen of Quirk—made a performance art-cum-messenger app? Released today, Somebody is a free app where users send messages not to friends, but to nearby Somebody users who act as human surrogates to deliver verbal messages in person to the desired recipient.

	In an accompanying short film that premiered at the Venice Film Festival (above), the app is introduced through a crying woman who sends a breakup text to her boyfriend. The scene cuts to a park where a third guy gets a notification on Somebody that says ""Look for Caleb"" with an image of the soon-to-be heartbroken young man. The surrogate walks up to Caleb and relays the crushing message while faux-crying (plus an awkward pause where he forgets a line). ""Texting is tacky. Calling is awkward. Email is old,"" explains a press release, so naturally sending human avatars to break up with our partners is the future of communication. 

	Made in support with Miu Miu, July describes the app as a ""far-reaching public art project, inciting performance and conversation about the value of inefficiency and risk."" Furthermore, ""Somebody twists our love of avatars and outsourcing—every relationship becomes a three-way."" If you're into that kind of uninhibited utopia, the app's hotspots include the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The New Museum, and other cultural centers. For better or worse, we couldn't imagine a more July-friendly tech project, though we're still not any closer to understanding what her whole deal is. 

Find out more about Somebody and download it over on the project's website.

"|>>5 Things We Learned from The Knick's Medical Advisor|>>","|>>http://mentalfloss.com/article/58737/5-things-we-learned-knicks-medical-advisor|>>","|>>Dr. Stanley Burns is the medical advisor for The Knick, a medical drama starring Clive Owen and directed by Steven Soderbergh. We have a lengthy interview with Dr. Burns; here are five highlights.
1. His Million-Photo Collection is Mostly Organized in His Head
When I asked how Dr. Burns keeps his collection organized, his answer surprised me:
Dr. Burns: It's in my head. [E]very time we do a book, then that subject gets organized, it gets scanned, it gets numbered, labeled. So that as far as [the upcoming book] Stiffs, Skulls & Skeletons is concerned, the book will have 450 photographs, but in order to produce that we've scanned about somewhere between 2,500 and 3,000 images from which we edit it down.

2. Clive Owen Could Suture You Up
Dr. Burns taught the cast basic medical procedures so they could do a convincing job on-camera...and the actors feel quite confident about their skills.
Dr. Burns: [The actors said], ""Well, if I came across an accident or if I had to suture someone up now, I know how to do it."" And this was a general comment right across the board and it is something great to learn, how to be able to put stitches in and take stitches and do all that.

Dr. Burns added, ""I'd let Clive suture me up.""
3. Doctors Became Addicts Via Self-Experimentation
Discussing the various drug addictions depicted in the show, Dr. Burns explained that these addictions sometimes came about because doctors were doing their jobs.
Dr. Burns: [Addictions were] common, but not for the reasons that you think. It was common because this was an era when doctors experimented on themselves. [...] I always talk about the great neurologist Henry Head, who cut his own nerves, and of course he would have a permanent defect afterwards, to find out what innervation was and what it was like. ... [Doctors] practiced on themselves and they didn't know the side effects of all these drugs.

4. Pioneers of the X-Ray Lost Fingers
Asked about the dangers presented by early X-ray machines shown on The Knick, Dr. Burns told me a rather grim story.
Dr. Burns: How dangerous? [...] Edison, who of course was a great electrical scientist of the era, because you need electricity to run the machine, recognized that his hands were getting red, I think, so he had his assistant [Clarence] Dally doing all the X-rays and the fluoroscopies, and Dally was dead by 1904. I think he had only been working on it for about seven or eight years and what happens is the doctor's fingers were falling off, they were getting squamous cell carcinoma, and a whole bunch of other carcinomas from exposure to the X-ray.

5. Today's Medical Practices May Look Foolish in 100 Years
Closing out our interview, Dr. Burns gives some perspective on technological advances in medicine.
Dr. Burns: One of the statements I say to everyone I meet, just so you get the correct idea about these doctors, is that these doctors from 1900 and the doctors from 1700 and 1800 are just as smart as you and I, just as innovative, just as genius. The problem is they labored under inferior knowledge in technology and all they tried to do was help and heal. They did the best they could, but the advance of medicine and technology is so great that a hundred years later a lot of the stuff looks foolish and you're wondering why a patient would put up with it. And what we're doing today will be looked at, I'm sure, a hundred years from now the same way.

"|>>How Should I Chill My Glassware?|>>","|>>http://mentalfloss.com/article/58722/how-should-i-chill-my-glassware|>>","|>>For most of us, chilling glasses and mugs should be easy: Throw them in the fridge for a few hours before the big party. But if you’ve ever left this task to the last minute, you know that it takes a while—even if they’re put in the freezer.
Chill Out
Cocktails reach their theoretical ideal temperature and dilution point when they’re poured out of the mixing vessel. Since they’re alcoholic, these drinks should be a bit colder than 32°F/0°C – the freezing point of water. Chilling the glass keeps the liquid inside cooler for longer. But don’t take it from me – Frederic Yarm has done extensive tests that demonstrated the difference.
Getting Cooler
The only real limit on methods to cool glassware is your imagination, but quite a few different approaches have been tried. Arguably the fastest (and most likely the priciest) is by using liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is extremely cold, as it’s a liquid only between -346°F and -320°F. At these temperatures, it cools glass down really, really fast. However, it won’t shatter the glass because a layer of nitrogen gas forms around the liquid and acts as an insulator.
The two methods that Yarm compared for making cups colder were to put a glass in the freezer and to fill another with ice and water. Though freezing the glass took about a minute longer to get to 32°F, it will continue to get colder afterwards.
Another possibility is to hold the glass in front of the fan in the freezer. Like a convection oven, this fan creates a simliar effect by circulating air and keeping the temperature steady throughout the chamber. By keeping a glass in front of the fan, the cold air in that area is constantly replaced by fresh, colder air. If your freezer’s fan doesn’t automatically turn on when you open the door, you can place a battery-operated fan in the freezer directed towards your glass.
Yet another way is to wrap each glass with a damp paper towel before throwing it in the freezer. This tactic cools glasses down approximately twice as fast as ice water. Since freezers tend to be very dry environments, water evaporates quickly. Simply misting glasses with water results in the liquid pooling inside, which causes it to evaporate much more slowly. Using a wrung out paper towel distributes this effect to the whole glass.
A final way to cool a glass is to chill vodka (or, if you’re throwing a cocktail party, whatever spirit you’re using for the drinks) in the freezer and then pour it into the glass. Booze left in this environment will chill down below the freezing point of water. After its use as a coolant, the spirit can be poured out of the glass for later consumption. Since booze isn’t perfectly flavorless, it will still leave hints of its taste in the glass.
Hit The Lab
If you doubt Yarm’s conclusion, set up your own experiment, either with a method we outlined or one of your own. If you want to see the effect of a chilled glass on the cocktail’s temperature, make a full cocktail and divide it between a chilled glass and a room temperature one. Keep sipping, and note differences in tasting notes and temperature over time.
New York Cocktail
This whiskey sour variation pairs whiskey with lime juice, simple syrup, and a touch of grenadine. It’s a strange combination, but the result is a beautiful cocktail with candied apple and spice notes.
1 tsp grenadine (equal parts Pom and white sugar)
1/2 oz simple syrup (equal parts hot water and white sugar)
3/4 oz lime juice
2 oz bold rye whiskey
Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds or until chilled through. Strain into a cold coupe glass.|>>","|>>none|>>","|>>Counter()|>>"

Brandy Allen’s mugshot may be in itself incriminating, as the Arkansas woman is accused of shoplifting $144 worth of makeup.
When Allen was confronted after stuffing the makeup into her bag, she unleashed a slew of profanity while attempting to damage the eyeshadow as she pulled it from her purse, so it’d seem the products were used, police said.

The incident occurred on Monday. By Wednesday, police said that Allen was released on bond. You have to wonder what color she’ll be wearing to her next court hearing.
School Fire Occurs During Fire Drill
God's Bible College staged a fire drill Tuesday morning to show incoming students what to do in case of a fire. It turned out that it was a case of fire! The Cincinnati Fire Department was on hand for the drill, and before they left, one of the firefighters spotted smoke coming from the roof. A fire was found on the third floor of the building, and was completely extinguished within 15 minutes. The fire, sparked by a bathroom exhaust fan, caused around $5,000 damage. It could have been a lot worse if the fire department hadn’t already been on the scene.
Robin Hood Monkey Distributes Stolen Cash
In the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, monkeys run wild because Hindus consider macaques sacred. The monkeys often cause havoc, knowing they will not be harmed. On Sunday, one monkey entered a home in the state capital of Shimla and, finding no food available, grabbed about 10,000 rupees cash ($165). It then climbed to a roof to play with the money, and then began throwing it at people. There was a rush to catch the money, as you would expect. The monkey moved to the trees, but a crowd of people followed, trying to catch the money as it was thrown. The monkey appeared to be enjoying the attention. There is no word of whether any of the cash was returned to its original owner.
Vigilante Justice for Duck Rustlers
A pair of teenage boys were forced to pay for stealing ducks with a unique punishment meted out by locals in a small village in Guangxi province, China.
Locals forced the two teenage boys to kneel by the side of the road holding two of the dead ducks in their mouths.
The 14-year-old crooks then had dead birds slung round their necks by their legs as they walked through a village in southern region of Guangxi.

Local police say the villagers should have called them about the thefts, but villagers say the police are useless because of slow response time.
Hand-drawn License Plate Will Not Do
A Massachusetts state trooper pulled over Johanna Baez-Rodriguez near Springfield on Tuesday morning because her license plate didn’t look right. The license plate was hand-drawn with colored pencils on a piece of white cardboard. Baez-Rodriguez had made the replacement plate herself after the state had revoked her vehicle’s plate. She was charged with driving on a suspended license, driving on a revoked registration, and other charges.
Human Skull Donated to Goodwill
Employees at the North Lamar Goodwill store in Austin, Texas, received a shock as they sorted through donations in July. Someone had donated a skull -a genuine human skull.

While this five-minute video is literally just showing a fruit harvest (with no narration or other production touches), it's great.  You see how a tarp is rolled out under the tree, how the tree is shaken, how the cherries are collected and sorted, and how quickly the whole operation moves from tree to tree.  There is a weird satisfaction when the crew attaches their shaking arm to the tree, performs a light shake, and it rains cherries for two seconds.  Now I want cherries.
