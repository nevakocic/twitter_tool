|>>Expressive Portraits by Rosie Hardy Venture into the Stunning Realm of Fantasy|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150279|>>,"|>>
For anyone who follows the work of young, talented photographers who belong to the Flickr community, Rosie Hardy is one name that comes up time and time again. Although only 23 years old, the Manchester, UK-based creative has been at the forefront of the movement of youthful, Flickr photographers who produce highly expressive images that venture into the surreal. With her captivating photos, Hardy has inspired the likes of Alex Stoddard and Phillip Schumacher. Since we last shared her work, the young photographer has enjoyed greater fame and recognition for her skill, even producing photos for big names like Maroon 5 and The 1975.
Looking at Hardy's stunning portfolio, it's not hard to understand her artistic success. Although diverse in their subject matter and composition, all of the images reveal a dreamlike, emotional world rendered in gorgeous tones. Her photos contain a compelling touch of fantasy, whether in the form of angel wings sprouting from the back of a young woman, lightbulbs hanging from the sky, or a courageous man facing off against a fierce lion.
When asked what made her pursue photography, Hardy—who describes herself as an ""escape artist""—wrote on her blog, ""I leap into these worlds which are in my head, which exist in songs and poetry and art. There's something else out there, there's a freedom which you can't grasp. . . So I take photos.""

|>>Innovative Kids Room Features Hammock Seating and Modular Furniture|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150097|>>,"|>>When the studio Ruetemple created a room in a Russian home meant for a young brother and sister, they didn’t take a conventional approach to the design. The two-storey space, called Interior for Students, needed to be a place for the kids to study, sleep, and hang out with their friends. So, architects Alexander Kudimov and Daria Butahina filled it with some fun details like a mezzanine hammock and a moveable cube. They built a fixed space for school work and dynamic areas for play using none of your typical furniture.
The lower level of the 108 square-foot room features a modular seating and sleeping cube on wheels. It can be arranged as a trio of sofas, as a long continuous line, or even closed up and made into a room within a room. Fixed office furniture occupies the other side of the space, and it includes desks, cupboards, shelves, and a staircase. All items are made from the same materials so that they appear as one cohesive piece of furniture.
The mezzanine level is devoid of flooring and has construction netting in its place. This creates an over-sized hammock that’s perfect for reading and relaxing. On its own, the upper level is too low to comfortably stand in, so Ruetemple devised a clever solution that gives this space a function. The innovative design is appealing to kids with clean, minimalist interior lines that feel grown up.

After one-of-a-kind wedding wildfire snapshots, spectacular photos of a bride and groom in an ice cave, and Jurassic Park-inspired nuptial photos featuring Jeff Goldblum, the latest wedding photos to go viral are these vibrant shots by Anchorage-based photographer Josh Martinez, who traveled by helicopter to Alaska's Knik Glacier with an adventurous bride and groom for one unforgettable portrait session.
During the photo shoot, the couple frolicked through lush meadows set against a backdrop of snowy mountains, explored icy fields, and even waded knee-deep into a glacial pool of stunningly blue water—ruining the wedding gown in the process. For such incredible photos, we think it may have been worth it!
Martinez, who works for Chugach Peaks Photography, shared with PetaPixel, ""The Bride & Groom gave me full creative freedom and in this case, that meant wading knee-deep into an icy glacial pool for Alaska’s ultimate trash-the-dress session! To access this incredible location, we explored the surface of the glacier by helicopter and located several pools of Windex-blue water that fit my vision perfectly. Our pilot landed on the glacier, and after fitting some safety gear we headed out to explore this epic world of ice, silt and water.""

|>>Giant Hippo Sculpture Playfully Floats Along the Thames River|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150246|>>,"|>> As part of Totally Thames, Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman recently installed a giant hippopotamus sculpture in the Thames river. The 70-foot-long wooden creature, playfully titled HipppoThames, was constructed over a small ship so that it would appear half-submerged in the water. Big googly eyes and hot pink nostrils make this giant animal look like a lot of fun. According to the artist, the piece was inspired by the hippos who used to inhabit the river during prehistoric times.
The conspicuous project is a continuation of the artist's signature style of creating massively unexpected sculptures inspired by everyday things, including Giant Slugs, a Rubber Duck, and a Sunbathing Hare. ""The purpose of setting my sculptures in the public domain has always been to give members of the public a break from their daily routines, to inspire conversation and to cause astonishment,"" explains Hofman.
HipppoThames will remain afloat at Nine Elms on the South Bank in central London through September 28, 2014.

After nearly two years of meticulous work, Pittsburgh-based artists Paul Roden and Valerie Lueth—known collectively as Tugboat Printshop—have unveiled Overlook, a stunningly intricate woodcut that will be used to make limited edition color prints. The duo, who are known for their incredibly detailed pieces, have really set the bar with their most complex woodblock yet: a dizzyingly packed landscape filled with pine-dotted mountains, rolling hills, man-tilled fields, and layered groves of thick, lush trees.
To create Overlook, the artists first drew the design, then used small knives and chisels to carve into surface of the 28"" x 46"" block. After the key detail is finished, they will carve an additional 3-4 color blocks. Printed in layers using one block at a time, the final product will be a vibrant work of art with staggering detail and breadth.
The print will be available as a singular, diptych, triptych, or an entire room's worth of wallpaper that shows the vista extending endlessly. To snag your own limited edition print, be sure to pre-order Overlook on Tugboat Printshop's website.

|>>Mirrored Suitcase Reflects Captivating City Scenes|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1150172|>>,"|>> Photographer Rui Calçada Bastos used a mirrored suitcase as the main focus to develop this engaging series, entitled The Mirror Suitcase Man, where images overlap in complex arrangements. Using light and reflections, Calçada Bastos captured moments in which a man carries a suitcase across a fragmented scene. The unique black and white project not only presents visually interesting compositions, but also offers viewers a small glimpse into the space behind the camera.
Through his lens, Calçada Bastos composed fantastic optical illusions and created a harmonious balance between two distinct spaces. The rectangular frame within a frame interrupts the scene and provides a striking combination of elements, from urban sidewalks and subway trains to patches of grass and cloudy skies. Though there are many recognizable objects within the photographs, Calçada Bastos provides no sense of certainty in each fleeting moment and viewers are left to wonder about the subject: Where is he headed? Is he coming or going? And where will he end up?

All together, this impressive 360 degree public artwork measures 23,500 square feet!
This mural is part of Os Gemeos’ (known separately as Otavio and Gustavo Pandolfo) international series, Giants, and is their largest undertaking to date. It’s also the first time that their work will appear in Canada. The Vancouver Biennale helped to organize this project as part of their city-wide effort to convert urban landscapes into open air exhibitions across the city.
“We did not want a conventional two-dimensional wall that we had done before – we wanted something different, special and unique,” the brothers explain. “ As the proposed biennale has a strong connection with sculpture, we decided to find a place where the painting can be transformed, creating a dialogue between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional worlds.”
The completed mural is set to be formally revealed on Sunday, September 7 of this year.

|>>My Modern Shop Spotlight - Kenji Croman's Breathtaking Wave Photography|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149985|>>,"|>> Photographer Kenji Croman naturally discovered his love for the ocean at a young age while growing up in Hawaii. He spent his teen years boogie boarding and bodysurfing and experiencing the power of the crashing waves firsthand. Eventually, as an adult, Croman discovered that he could share these amazing experiences with others through photography.
With a waterproof camera strapped to his wrist, the adventurous photographer ventures out into the rough waters in order to capture nature at its best. He has only a few brief seconds to document the curling waves before they crash down upon him. In his bio, Croman states, ""I am constantly driven to get that better shot. It isn’t just about taking pictures for me anymore; it is being creative and trying to capture the beauty in nature in an artistic way.""
We're pleased to announce that all of the images featured in this post are now available as prints and canvases through our art store, My Modern Shop.

The project, developed by HG-Architecture | LIVE COMPONENTS, was recently commissioned by the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Korea. The large scale installation piece is intended to visually convey the idea that larger forms are generally composed of smaller elements, firmly constructed together to make the whole.

The project statement explains: ""Everything in nature is made up of components. It starts from basic components like atoms and molecules, and grows to bigger components like tissues and organs in order to construct a ‘live’ body. The artificial environment is quite the same. It all starts with basic components like points and lines, and grows to surface and finally construct a space.""
The piece appears differently depending on the viewer's perspective. Concave and convex curves create unusual spaces that move in wavelike motions across the room. Visitors are invited to investigate around the exterior and to walk underneath the construction to experience the details up close.

Victoria, British Columbia-based artist duo Andreas Kunert and Naomi Zettl create gorgeous, decorative wall installations out of stone. The husband and wife, who own their own stonework design, consulting, and sculpting firm called Ancient Art of Stone, specialize in building murals, fireplaces, and other stunning mosaic patterns from a wide array of rocks and pebbles.
The couple's installations are filled with an incredible amount of intricate detail, with hundreds of stones fitting together perfectly to form color-coordinated swirls. For such a hard, solid material, the designs that Kunert and Zettl create are astonishingly organic and graceful, flowing beautifully in spirals and waves across the surface of walls.
""Our inspiration flows directly from nature and the pure simple forms and rhythms that are inherent within the creative forces of the Earth,"" the duo writes on their website. ""Our medium is stone, which is both timeless and sustaining. . . Our creative works flow naturally and intuitively from the basic founding principles and building blocks of all creation, through sacred geometry.""

Many of us imagine giant, billowing creatures slowly floating by. Taking this fun a step further is Spanish creative and copywriter Martín Feijoó who brings the fantasies to life with a pen. His series, titled Shaping Clouds, features illustrations that are drawn on top of cloud formations. They represent the first thing that came to his mind once he saw their distinctive silhouettes.
Shaping Clouds started while Feijoó was travelling. “When I was a child I was told that clouds’ shapes were created by expert balloon twister clowns who live in the sky, so that they can keep entertaining children,” he explains on his Tumblr. “On my last trip to Mexico I remembered this and I started to photograph clouds on the road.”
The result of Feijoó’s journey is a whimsical series with detailed line drawings of a long necked platypus, big-headed duck, ferocious T-Rex, and more. It reminds us that even though we might look at the same sky, we all imagine something a little different floating up there.

If you haven’t eaten a McDonald’s Happy Meal in a while, you might’ve forgotten what they look like. But, even so, we can guarantee you that they don’t look like this. Artist Newt Clements has reimagined the iconic fast food packaging and replaced its standard bright red box with pop culture icons, movies, and television shows. They even come complete with a new toy!
Clements created a plethora of Happy Meal tribute boxes that include films like The Shining, shows like Breaking Bad, and celebrities like Nikki Minaj. And, of course there’s one dedicated to Grumpy Cat. It’s an amusing and well-crafted series that’s fun and subversive at the same time.
While some who see the unique Happy Meals “get” the joke, Clements has fooled others into thinking that they’re real. His “Ouija board” design caused a backlash when shared on Facebook, and it even earn him a place on Snopes. The rumor-busting site confirmed that McDonalds will not be producing this specially-themed Meal for Halloween this year.

For millennia, cultures around the world have celebrated the origin myth of of a giant animal—such as a turtle or elephant—supporting the world on its back. Beijing-based artist Ruilin Wang reinterprets that image in DREAMS-ark, an evocative series of sculptures that depict whales carrying entire landscapes on their backs.
Each large-scale work consists of a distinct type of whale paired with a different world. Rocky, alpine mountains sprout from the back of a sleek blue whale. A sperm whale balances a placid, icy pool on its back. From the back of a humpback whale rises a range of misty, tree-covered cliffs reminiscent of the mountains commonly depicted in traditional Chinese ink paintings.
Wang's series is a dreamy retelling of myth and folklore, reducing the entirety of the world into diminutive landscapes carried by whales that swim nebulously through the void. Both organic and architectural in form, the sculptures are a beautiful representation of nature, origins, and life.

The thick, wooden sculptures are a fascinating display of the artist's illustration capabilities in a unique form. Intricately twisted curves and swirls form fantastic tales of animals fighting in the forest, elaborate sea serpents, and skeletons hiding in the closet. Energy and motion radiate from each whirling curl and undulation.
Tomsky is passionate about creating interesting visual narratives through his art. He explains, ""My personal work and illustrations for children are primarily about creating new worlds, unique characters to inhabit those worlds and to depict stories which bring them to life.""

Wood directs optical projections towards each dynamic, wall mounted structure in order to control how light hits each piece. Through this creative illumination, his visually intriguing, geometric formations are quickly transformed into sparkling patterns of color and texture.
Wood explains, ""Glass is a material which allows me to exploit the aesthetic potential of light. Minimal structures, support simple arrangements of glass, which interact with light to create complex patterns of light and shade, which change depending upon the position of the viewer and the angle of the light source.""

Indiana-based folk artist Jamie Homeister uses delicate feathers as her canvas for intricate paintings of animals. Giving a nod to her Canadian heritage and Native American culture, Homeister meticulously builds up layers of paint on the fragile surface, depicting parrots, owls, eagles, finches, and even animals like foxes and bears. Many of her commissioned portraits are even painted on feathers that belonged to the birds depicted themselves, bringing the artwork one step closer to nature and wildlife.
""Featherwork is an incredibly humbling media,"" the artist says. ""The feathers splice, buckle, splinter and shred under the weight of paint. Layering them in my multi-feather formations is even more difficult to execute, as you have layers of light, airy, thinly threaded buoyancy.""

Artist Sarah A. Smith uses the unique medium of gold leaf to create glimmering, dynamic drawings that burst with movement and texture. Titled Gold Drawings, her collection of large-scale works commonly depict animals, landscapes, and other elements from nature in stunning, metallic swirls and shapes.
Smith uses a combination of metal leaf, corrosive, ink, and pencil blended together on paper to produce her shimmering scenes. To create her works, she dips her brush into a jar of diluted copper sulfate and brushes it across the shiny surface of the metal leaf, sparking an acidic reaction that oxidizes the elements.
The artist's use of this harsh chemical process—which corrodes, tarnishes, and destroys the gold material—makes a powerful statement about society's obsession with commerce and material goods. By treating the precious metal in such an unforgiving manner, Smith criticizes the impact that our excessive, consumption-driven ways have had on the environment.

A childhood fascination with his father’s collection of electrical and engineering components influenced his creation of these intricately-crafted and imaginative creatures. Oliver painstakingly collects objects like mechanical gears, old tins, eyeglass arms, and more as raw materials for his work. He then arranges items into fictitious insects, assigns them scientific names, and places the finished pieces into handmade wooden frames.
Oliver’s specimen-like treatment of his artwork is a nod to the Victorian tradition of insect collecting, which is the trapping and displaying of bugs for study. His work is fascinating from a distance and reveals its beauty up close. Make sure you carefully inspect these “bugs” so that you don’t miss out on seeing all of the interesting components that Oliver has amassed over time.

Titled The Preciousness of the Hunt, it was arranged by the Do Art Foundation and is located in the downtown area. Her painted work is not only eye-catching, but playfully interacts with the ground below; at certain angles it looks like the birds are emerging from the trees.
Using a combination of spray paint and brushes, Faith47 has done an incredible job of making this massive artwork look as effortless as a sketch. She layers opaque pigment and gestural marks that give the illusion of it being drawn with a pencil. This effect pairs nicely with the green wall it’s painted on as we see the colored brick peeking through the swans’ wings.

Cape Town-based photographer Anelia Loubser explores this idea in her series Alienation, which is a collection of portraits that capture people turned upside down. The black and white photographs are zoomed in and show us crystal-clear depictions of the eyes, foreheads, and hair in ways that we aren’t used to seeing.
With this slight shift, Loubser creates entirely new faces that are uniquely strange yet oddly familiar because of their human features; a quick glance could make it seem as if these pictures are of alien beings. It results in a beautifully eerie set of images that are wonderfully expressive thanks to forehead wrinkles and arresting sets of eyes. We’re able to appreciate how small changes in our vantage point can produce completely new, interesting compositions and stories.

|>>Miniature Silhouetted People Playfully Interact With the Urban Landscape|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149604|>>,"|>>Three years ago, the artist Pejac lived in a house with a lot of windows located in Valencia, Spain. He didn’t have any curtains hung, but used the crystal-clear view of apartment buildings and a security camera to experiment with paper and acrylic works on glass. Pejac's lack of privacy coupled with ample sunlight resulted in simple silhouetted pieces that play with scale and his surrounding urban landscape.
Although the artist is recognized for his outdoor street art, we can’t help but be captivated by these smaller, more intimate works. They cleverly integrate figures in situations that we’d never imagine anyone to be: standing on the top of a very tall and thin pole, swinging off a building’s roof, and fishing for birds flying in mid air. At first glance, these optical illusions seem to fool the eye into thinking that they’re real.
The playful works from the past have influenced one of Pejac’s more recent pieces, which features a window drawing of a tightrope walker. It’s a tribute to the legendary French high-wire walker Philippe Petit and commemorates the 40th anniversary of his journey between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City.

Canadian photographer Christopher Moloney brings the magic of cinema to life with FILMography, an ongoing art project that matches scenes from movies with their real-life, present-day locations. After printing out a black-and-white still from a film, Moloney holds up the print and snaps a photo of it aligned perfectly with the actual building, street, or or landmark behind it.
The stark juxtaposition of the movie still and the real-life location not only emphasizes the passage of time since the scene was filmed, but also calls attention to the astonishing fact that such ordinary places have been traversed by the likes of Anne Hathaway and Tom Hanks.
Since we last shared FILMography in 2012, Moloney has ventured beyond the iconic streets of New York City, traveling to places as distant as Rome and Naples to recreate famous movie scenes. Regardless of location, however, the fascinating series serves as a reminder of the spark of joy that a good film can bring to our everyday lives.

In an amusing example of a typical PsBattle, a Reddit user recently challenged fellow Redditors to create Photoshopped variations of the same image of an old woman using a puppet of herself to feed a squirrel. As one might imagine, the results are absolutely hilarious.
Some users chose to play around with the subjects of the photo, switching the old lady, the puppet, the squirrel, or even the bystander with each other. Others, inspired by the aesthetic of films like Pirates of the Caribbean or Michael Bay productions, added grandiose visual effects, such as in the cinematic shot of the elderly woman standing at the center of a whirlpool. A few Redditors even got meta on us, creating images that show the woman controlling an infinite line of puppets of herself, or being controlled by the squirrel itself in a circle of puppetry.
For more humorous demonstrations of imagination and Photoshop prowess, be sure to check out other PsBattles on Reddit.

|>>Unique Engagement Ring Box Pirouettes the Ring Like a Blooming Flower|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149291|>>,"|>>Marriage proposals can be scary, even if you know that the other person will say yes. How and where you’ll ask is always a factor, as well as where to hide the ring. After all, it’d be tragic if it were discovered beforehand. A slimline engagement ring box called Clifton solves this potential problem. Designed by Andrew Zo, it’s no bigger than the size of a wallet and slides into your pocket with ease. Plus, when you open the Clifton, the ring does more than just appear - it pirouettes into position. This is because a pop-up mechanism is meant to present the ring as if it’s a blooming flower.
Zo is a packaging designer by trade, and he first began developing Clifton as a student at Emily Carr University in Vancouver, Canada. He built a paper-based proof of concept in 2011 and over the past three years has refined it into the leather-bound product that we see today.
Clifton is available for purchase with a pricetag of $90. While that might seem like a lot, consider that the average engagement ring is $2,300; this means that the box only adds 4% onto the total expense. It could be seen as a negligible cost to make a once-in-a-lifetime event even more special.

|>>Incredible Wheelchair-Bound Man Completes Ironman Triathlon Alongside His Twin Brother|>>,|>>http://www.mymodernmet.com/xn/detail/6633894:BlogEntry:1149321|>>,"|>>
Last Sunday, 34-year-old Peder Mondrup became the first person with cerebral palsy to complete an Ironman triathlon, thanks to his own determination and the tremendous love and support of his twin brother, Steen. Using special equipment, Steen swam 2.4 miles while pulling Peder on a rubber raft, biked 112 miles with his brother seated in front of him, and ran 26.2 miles while pushing Peder in a wheelchair across hilly terrain. It took the incredible duo 15 hours, 32 minutes, and 48 seconds to complete the grueling KMD Ironman Copenhagen Challenge, but they finally crossed the finish line together amidst the bright lights and loud cheers of spectators close to midnight on August 24.
The twins, who call themselves Team Tvilling (""Team Twin"" in Danish), were born three months premature and weighing only 2.6 pounds each in 1980. Peder, who suffered a lack of oxygen that caused severe cerebral palsy, has been confined to a wheelchair for all of his life. This physical handicap hasn't held him back, however, as he's participated in a variety of marathons and races with Steen, with those efforts finally culminating in the spectacular completion of the extremely demanding Ironman.
""For the first time, I felt like the person I see myself as: a regular participant instead of 'somebody in a wheelchair,'"" said Peder. His brother shared, ""If I can give Peder the feeling of not sitting in a wheelchair for a few hours, then I will do whatever it takes! I feel like I am really lucky because he has caused me to see the positive in life and to not complain about everyday things. One thing is certain and that is that you never have and never will hear Peder feel sorry for himself.""
The twins, who joke that Steen got ""the legs"" and Peder got ""the brains,"" hope to pursue their dream of giving handicapped people the chance to feel the joy and pride of participating in races and other sports events. With their Ironman accomplishment only serving as the beginning of their journey, they have established the non-profit Team Twin Association, with the goal of establishing the world’s first triathlon training camps for the disabled in 2015. ""We are really excited about this next step for Team Twin,"" they said. ""The work has already begun and will now get our full attention.""

But, one small thing made it even better. Their baby boy was giving a thumbs up! You can clearly see in the hilarious photo that he’s saying that he “approves” of the ultrasound.
Since meancloth posted the picture on Reddit a mere few days ago, it’s gotten a massive 2.25 million views. The unusual and amusing gesture makes the baby Internet-famous before he’s even born. The little guy won’t be alone, though. If you notice in the top left corner, it says “Baby A,” which means he’s going to be a twin.

It was created in 2012 by FRM which is founded by Yugo Nakamura, recognised as one of the world’s most innovative web and interactive designers, and by William Lai whose work spans across product design and user experience, with a focus on physical products combined with the collaborative nature of the web.After two years they have developed FRAMED* 2.0 which it won't be just a display to showcase digital art but a platform,  a community hub and a marketplace where artists will have the opportunity to publish and sell their work.Behind of FRAMED* 2.0 there are major concerns about how digital art could spread itself around the Internet and into different artistic networks to be seen and collected through this beautifully designed canvas, and I believe that the right people is working on, as you may know Yugo Nakamura besides to be an award-winning Japanese software artist is the creator of FFFOUND!, yes the website and social image bookmarking service you used to use or still do to pick up some fresh visual inspiration, and that has been a great reference as a collectible and sharable based image platform and had an important impact about the way we discovered images online today. I highly recommend to read a recent conversation Filip Visnjic from CreativeApplications.Net had with William Lai about this, read here.FRM started yesterday a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter to raise funds in order to start this project and be able to commercialise this product if they reach the budget goal. They are offering nice offers for supporting this project from the lowest prices. To see that in one day they have duplicated the goal, it's a great response from the digital art community and everyone who believes on it.

You can follow Sabrina's work over Computers Club (here) and at Drawing Society (here) where she has a great archive of magic, celestial and architectonic based drawings. ""Visites Possibles explores the possibilities of creating 3D environments based on video images generated only by electronic signals. Inspired by architectural renderings and the idea of virtual tour, the video invites the viewer to visit its structure through specific parameters. The walls of the space embed doors which open and close randomly, thus revealing only glimpses of different electronic landscapes. While these landscapes are being revealed, they are also pushed away by the simulated camera movement, leaving only a limited time for contemplation. Consequently, the lateral scrolling of the image controls the visit, both spatially and time-wise. It also creates a sense of spatial continuity, which contrasts with the constant morphing of the space, changing into different configurations, without following any physical logic. Throughout the visit, ""entities"" arise and disappear regularly as if haunting this virtual environment. Visites Possibles also acts as a transitory space where multiple doors open on potential virtual experiences."" - Sabrina Ratté.SEE MORE INTO THE POST:|>>",|>>http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c1PwhdbfZeU/U4RAq3XN98I/AAAAAAAAN6Q/gcbc2FLkvFA/s1600/Sabrina+Ratte%CC%81+TRIANGULATION.jp+09.png|>>,|>>Counter()|>>

Through devices one has the possibility to literally peel-off and distinguish certain capacities as well as leave others in the dark. Data Drawings was produced during a 6 month residency at the Citè des Arts in Paris. I began to collect the bandwidth qualities of the WLAN in my studio with a simple iPhone App and wrote it down. Similar to a diary, but just with numeric information such as: Download: 972.0, Upload: 91.9, Ping 34 kB/s. I did this whenever I was physically in my studio. Sometimes I measured every minute, sometimes every hour. After a while, I came up with translating this informations onto a 3d grid in Rhino. Simultaneously I have experimented with drawing techniques of how to achieve something like all-over drawings which reflects back to the ideas of covering and multiplying. For each drawing I used the diagram I calculated on this specific day when I started to draw it. For me this technique allows to think about spaces in very blurred coherences, without depicting the place. On one hand you have this physical work (pencil and acrylic on paper), which is very abstract, on the other hand this abstract drawing has ""real"" numeric information behind every single line."" - Peter Jellitsch.

I use a series of offscreen framebuffer's to pile on different filters, and then feed the output of the final on screen framebuffer back to one of the earlier ones to complete the feedback loop (just like pointing a camera at a screen that is displaying the camera feed). The filters themselves are shaders written in GLSL.Since these are made with shaders running on the GPU, it's super fast and can run in real-time at 60fps or faster. It's pretty satisfying to shake your head around and throw off gobs of color, so eventually I'd like to get everything working in webGL as a little web toy so that other people can play with the parameters and experience it for themselves."" - Adam Ferriss.Into the post you can find a brief explanation of each video and the source Adam used to experiment with.

Will a system without our sense of narrative or historical patterns of vision watch the same things?Computers Watching Movies was computationally produced using software written by the artist. This software uses computer vision algorithms and artificial intelligence routines to give the system some degree of agency, allowing it to decide what it watches and what it does not. Six well-known clips from popular films are used in the work, enabling many viewers to draw upon their own visual memory of a scene when they watch it. The scenes are from the following movies: 2001: A Space Odyssey, American Beauty, Inception, Taxi Driver, The Matrix, and Annie Hall."" - Benjamin Grosser.

It is basically an online pixel pattern painter, where the user has to create his/her own patterns and paint with. All the patterns are created into a 32 x 32px box which is the maximum size for the brush and in that space you can create whatever you want, I think 32px is enough for a pixel pattern tool, it's the double size than a favicon and per example you can reproduce a lot of already existent icons from the internet whose fit perfect on that space. To build your own patterns it's an interesting and creative process, one has to care quite a lot about the edges of the pattern because WendyPaint only offers one way painting mode which is by dragging the pattern and doing a continue stroke if you keep the brush going on, and one click equals one pattern, so edges are important on here. Once the pattern is done you can edit it using some rotating and flipping features and save them in different modes, but what it's really nice it's that you can also create others using little code through the colour pattern generator and modulator which works using i, x, y, w; variables and with that it's possible to create infinite geometric and glitchy patterns and gradients very quickly, some examples into the post. Another good point is that the users have the option to share the patterns they do and build a public huge archive of patterns, good online based concept. It also has a Stream where there are all the public pieces, make sure you click on the checkbox when saving your painting as it is hidden by default.

This week, a team of astronomers re-charted the supercluster of galaxies that includes the Milky Way, finding it to be 100 times bigger in volume and mass than previously thought. In a new study, published in the journal Nature, the researchers chronicled the motions of the galaxies, in order to determine the “gravitational landscape” of the local Universe. The team named the enormous supercluster Laniakea – Hawaiian for “immeasurable heaven.""

    Formula E Racecar  

KatherineLegge.com/Amlin Aguri 

In the April 2014 issue of Popular Science, we exploded the view of the racecar designed for Formula E -- the first fully electric, global racing championship. Back then the first round seemed so distant. But now drivers are only a week away from hitting the track inside shockingly quiet vehicles that can top 60 mph in about 3 seconds.
One of those drivers is British auto racer Katherine Legge, the first woman confirmed for Formula E. Popular Science is happy to report that we've partnered with Legge for her inaugural race -- which means we’ll be going along for the ride. At the launch of the Formula E series in Beijing on Saturday, September 13, Legge's helmet will be emblazoned with our logo as she competes against 19 other drivers. She also plans to post exclusive, on-the-ground reports here at PopSci.com. (Look for those starting next week.)
Why are we fans of Legge? Because she’s a fan of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. For example, Legge is a STEM ambassador for the Girl Scouts to remind young girls that they can succeed in any field if they work hard and believe in themselves.
We couldn’t agree more, which is why we’re hoping to give Legge a little extra boost out on the racetrack. And that's where you come in.
Formula E gives its fans an unprecedented chance to help out a driver through a system called FanBoost. In short, the three drivers with the most votes from registered fans get more speed. More specifically, they each get a 5-second, 30-kilowatt boost, ramping up their cars' 150 kilowatts of power to 180 kilowatts just before the race begins.
Fans can vote for only one driver, and voting closes on the day of the race. So be sure to cast yours before September 13. (Go Legge, go!)
Visit FanBoost to give Legge a leg up on the track.

Beer lovers: there may be more to your brew than dazzling citrus overtones or a subtle chocolatey aroma.
The authors of a new study went to a local supermarket in Germany and picked up 24 brands of beer, including the 10 most popular in the country. In the lab, they found plastic particles and other debris in everything they tested. The study was part of a larger investigation of plastic microfibres that are turning up all over the natural world as larger plastics break down. (In June, Illinois became the first state to ban plastic beads in cosmetics, which are thought to be one source of the pollution.)
How the plastic ended up in beer is an open question. The paper notes than some of the brands claim to use only spring water in their products, and sand particles often found around springs also showed up under the microscope. Malfunctioning equipment, unclean bottles, and even contaminated barley and hops are all possible sources. Beer may be filtered with activated charcoal, asbestos, wood chippings and other materials that could carry plastics.
The study only gets more shudder-worthy when it turns to the other debris they found.
""Workers in breweries lose, as any other people, the outer part of their epidermis,"" they write.
Scales of exfoliated skin were found in both small and larger chunks, along with bits of glass and even an ""almost complete"" dead insect.

    Non-synthetic particles in beer: (A) insect remain, order Thysanoptera; and (B) glass shard. Scale = 3.1 mm.  

    Gerd Liebezeita & Elisabeth Liebezeita  

The study concludes that none of the samples contained enough plastic or other materials to present a danger to the public. The important takeaway, the authors write, is that if these tiny plastic bits are making it into beer, they have penetrated the human environment.

Here's a roundup of the week's top drone news: the military, commercial, non-profit, and recreational applications of unmanned aircraft.
Through A Scan Eagle Darkly
The ethics of drone warfare are coming to the silver screen. “Good Kill,” a film starring Ethan Hawke and directed by Andrew Niccol, focuses on an American drone pilot based in Nevada. The film debuted at the Venice Film Festival today. The director hopes it will spark debate. Here’s hoping some of that debate addresses the mental health challenges that come with being a drone pilot.
Charges Against Prismatic Pilot
In August, a Dutch tourist flew a drone over Yellowstone National Park’s resplendent Grand Prismatic Spring. Unfortunately, the drone crashed into the 160-degree-Fahrenheit waters, where it remains today. The National Park Service banned drones from parks in June, and as a consequence the pilot, Theodorus Van Vliet, has been charged with $5,000 in fines and/or six months in jail and/or five years on probation. Under the same policy, the National Park Service has charged at least two another drone pilots.
Ram Versus Sky Cam
While the National Park Service is worried about drones hurting wildlife, perhaps it’s the drones that should fear the animals. In the below video, YouTube user Buddhanz1 flies a drone in search of a ram, and the ram headbutts the quadcopter right out of the sky. Watch the video:

Red Skies
At the Peace Mission 2014 exercises, forces from China, Russia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan all worked together in trial counter-terror practice. Together with absent member Uzbekistan, these countries form the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Together they tested normal operations incorporating drones. From our story:
Perhaps the most high profile Chinese weapon was the use of a Pterodactyl UCAV, considered the equivalent of the US MQ-9 Reaper, which bombed an enemy ""terrorist"" target with an ATF-10 ATGM.  The usage of a UCAV in what was actually a fairly conventional mechanized operation is something not yet well integrated in American operations of the equivalent aircraft. It also suggests that Chinese doctrine may be more risk-friendly in employing unmanned platforms against well-armed opponents than American drone use has been so far.
Drone Home
A local news station reports that a University of Texas student flew a drone over the university’s first home game. Police detained and questioned the student, but the murkiness of drone law leaves it unclear whether there's an existing law the student violated.

    Iraqi Army Soldiers In Light Armored Vehicles, 2007

When Iraq’s American-equipped army fled their posts in Mosul last June, they left that American equipment in the hands Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the attacking violent insurgent group. Since then, the U.S. Air Force destroyed some of the captured vehicles. Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, wonders if there’s a better way to stop stolen equipment from working. He proposes “kill switches,” like those found in iPhones, as a means for keeping American arms, given to allies, from working in the hands of enemies.
Here’s the key idea from Zittrain’s article:
It is past time that we consider whether we should build in a way to remotely disable such dangerous tools in an emergency. Other technologies, including smartphones, already incorporate this kind of capability. The theft of iPhones plummeted this year after Apple introduced a remote “kill switch,” which a phone’s owner can use to make sure no one else can use his or her lost or stolen phone. If this feature is worth putting in consumer devices, why not embed it in devices that can be so devastatingly repurposed—including against their rightful owners, as at the Mosul Dam?
Through email, Popular Science spoke with Zittrain about how these proposed killswitches could work, and what they would mean for arming allies in the future.
Popular Science: Cell phone kill switches work in a world filled with cellphone towers and internet connections--things that are rare on battlefields. I know you mention satellites, but what kinds of infrastructure do you think a kill switch would require?
Jonathan Zittrain: Some [military] hardware already relies on communications with a home base perhaps thousands of miles away. For example, remotely piloted drones. The technology used to securely direct drones might be usable for other instruments of war. Essentially, the more sophisticated and communications-based, such as relying upon military-grade GPS, the less of an incremental change a kill switch would represent.
PS: What kinds of military gear do you see as likely kill switch candidates?
JZ: Medium and heavy weaponry, including tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, helicopters, and jets.
PS: What safeguards could prevent an armed non-state actor from ""jailbreaking"" their killswitch-enabled MANPADS [Man Portable Air Defense Systems], tanks, or rifles?
JZ: No safeguard is foolproof, and physical possession of the gear in question is often thought of as ""game over"" from a hacking perspective. But if we see the problem in terms of time and effort to break the lock, rather than ""can it ever be broken,"" there may be useful ways of integrating this technology, especially when balanced against the costs of misuse of the weapons should they be completely unsecured. (Right now we might depend on such things as batteries that naturally expire and are hard to replace, or other maintenance that an adversary won't be in a position to do.)
Steven Bellovin at Columbia has done a lot of thinking about this problem for nuclear weapons, which need to be hardened against use should they fall into someone's wrongful possession. He's written up his thoughts here.
One could also imagine an expiration date requiring renewal with a code or signal, so that no adversary could hack the switch itself and render the weapon useless even if it hadn't been stolen. At most the hacker could allow the weapon to continue operating past its due date.

PS: Many small arms in current use are decades old if not older. Would you support retroactively adding kill switches to these before distribution, or are kill switches more for advanced equipment?
JZ: I see them as more useful for more advanced equipment. With the world awash in small arms, it seems harder to make a dent in that supply.
PS: With kill switch-equipped weapons, do you think the United States or others would be more likely to arm friendly non-state actors?
JZ: This is a distinct possibility, and could mean that kill switches would, as a second-order effect, lead to more arms being sold or given to parties. If the worst uses can be foreclosed -- or we convince ourselves that they are -- it changes the downside risk of providing the arms to begin with.
PS: Kill switches come with a major trust issue. While America might promise killswitchable weapons to an allied army so that an insurgent can't use them, what assurance would the ally have that the kill switch wouldn't leave them vulnerable?
JZ: That assurance may already be in question. Any secret kill switches already in use would presumably be used rarely in order not to eliminate that trust. Here, stated up front, a recipient knows the conditions by which the arms are transferred. The easy case is the recipient possessing the kill switch; the more difficult is the providing country having it; the most radical would be for the UN Security Council or some other group to have to come to consensus to trigger the switch.

    Working out burns calories, while making smelly skin microbes.

Chris Callewaert wants to solve body odor, starting with your gym clothes.
He and a team of European microbiologists have tackled a stifling mystery that permeates locker rooms and laundry hampers across the world: Why does gym gear reek even days after a workout?
A fair assumption would be that some fabrics trap more sweat than others, but perspiration on its own is sterile and does not produce foul odors.
Instead, pungent bacteria from our skin grow more readily on certain workout shirts, namely those made from synthetic textiles like polyester, according to new research from Callewaert and his colleagues at Ghent University in Belgium.
The scientists had 26 healthy individuals – 13 men and 13 women – participate in a spinning class, while wearing T-shirts made from natural or synthetic fibers. After the exercise, the shirts were stuffed into plastic bags and stored in the dark, akin to tossing gym clothes into a musty locker. After 28 hours, an independent panel of odor connoisseurs judged that the polyester shirts stank worse than cotton-based ones.
Skin germs feast on chemicals in sweat, turning them into pungent odor compounds, which the bacteria subsequently “fart” out.
Next, the researchers swabbed the shirts’ armpit regions for bacteria. Skin bacteria produce many of the scents connected to bad body odor -- and armpits are microbe havens.
To understand just how prolific bacteria are on our bodies, grab a ruler and pen. Draw a square one centimeter by one centimeter on your forearm. Around 100 bacteria live inside that square. In contrast, an identical square on your armpit, navel, or toe web spaces carries 10 million bacteria.
The most common known cause of malodor is a family of skin microbes in the genus Corynebacterium; however, the scientists couldn’t spot any on sweaty gym gear.
Rather they found that soiled polyester shirts wound up harboring more Micrococci bacteria, a type of odiferous germ, than cotton shirts. The result was surprising because Micrococci don’t generally grow in pits.
“As part of a separate, ongoing study, we’ve screened over 200 people, and found very low levels of Micrococci present on armpit skin,” says Callewaert. “Something about sweat-filled polyester enriches these sour-smelling bacteria.”

Skin germs feast on chemicals in sweat, turning them into pungent odor compounds, which the bacteria subsequently “fart” out. While natural textiles absorb this stench-filled water, Callewaert and his colleagues suspect that the funky juice pools in the microscopic spaces in between synthetic fibers, creating a great environment for bacteria to flourish.

To explore this idea, the team took a few pungent species of bacteria and tried growing them in Petri dishes coated with seven different fabrics: polyester, acryl, nylon, fleece, viscose, cotton, and wool.
The results were mixed. Cotton grew very few smelly germs, akin to earlier findings, while the microbes continued to swarm over polyester.
Synthetic nylon was a great refuge for Propionibacterium acnes, a species of bacteria that causes acne and foot odor. Natural wool supported every germ tested, while the scientists found one fabric – viscose – where bacteria didn’t grow.
This preliminary study could help inform clothing makers on how to create less smelly apparel.
“Many manufacturers have started adding antimicrobials, like nanosilver, to their clothes,” says coauthor Nico Boon, a microbial ecologist at Ghent University.
Such chemicals eliminate germs indiscriminately, meaning the good germs disappear with the bad. “This could potentially throw off our immune systems,” Boon continues. “We should manage and control the existing microbial community, so that we steer the germs in the way that we want, instead of killing everything,”
To keep garb from trapping workout odor, he and Callewaert recommend clothing hybrids, where the fabric coming in contact with armpits is made from cotton. The rest of the shirt could be synthetic fabric, which accumulates less heat and feels more comfy.
The researchers published their work in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

The American Southwest may be headed for a “megadrought,” an arid period longer than any in recent memory.
A megadrought is the name for a decades-long dry spell. Researchers have known since 1998 that megadroughts can occur in the region. Under normal conditions, dry periods of several decades or more come once or twice in a millennium, but the changing climate has made the danger much more imminent. Now, a new study has determined there is a 50 percent chance that a drought as long as 35 years will occur in the next century. And the chances of another decade-long drought are as high as 80 percent.
In order to understand the conditions that lead to these rare multi-decade dry periods, researchers went into the field to study the traces that ancient weather patterns leave behind. “You go up into the mountains and these beautiful places where moisture limits growth to take samples,” Dr. Toby Ault, lead researcher of the study, tells Popular Science.
In dry places, plants grow slower and the gaps between their annual tree rings are shorter. By matching up modern tree rings with ancient wood -- such as beams from pre-Columbian Native American desert dwellings -- researchers can track annual moisture patterns going back centuries. That’s an important part of how they know the Southwest has been through megadroughts before, as well as how often they've happened.
Plus, climate models have long predicted the Southwest will lose water as the Earth warms, and the prolonged drying period predicted for the coming years looks eerily similar to the periods that preceded the sustained dry periods of the past.
“This pretty robust feature of climate change models loads the dice toward droughts and megadroughts,” Ault says.
Decade-long droughts came about once a century in the pre-climate change world. Today, California and Arizona are parched. An ongoing 15-year drought is sucking dry the region’s reservoirs and drying out its forests, leading to a range of problems, including immediate concerns about water shortages in Tucson, Phoenix, and even Las Vegas.
There is some uncertainty as to the relationship between the region’s current struggles and climate change, but this drought points to what the whole Southwest may have to deal with if droughts become more widespread and longer-lasting. A megadrought could include New Mexico and Texas, and last as long as 35 years.
However, Ault says a megadrought in our lifetimes would not have to mean devastation for the American Southwest.
“Some of our best evidence of droughts comes from tree rings,” he points out. “That means some trees grew during dry periods. A megadrought doesn’t spell death and destruction for all creatures. Less water does not mean no water.”
Ault says he hopes his findings will encourage state and local water conservation groups to deal with the danger of water scarcity becoming the norm. Advances in water conservation and management have prevented the current Arizona drought from becoming as bad as the Dust Bowl, a shorter dry spell that devastated American plains agriculture during the Great Depression in the 1930s.
“As long as we accept that we are a clever and adaptable species -- and I think all evidence points to us being a clever and adaptable species -- we can mange this,” he says.

This year marks the centennial of the start of the First World War. To honor it, Popular Science is combing through our archives to bring you the best of our original war coverage--from the emergence of tanks, airplanes, and other military tech, to essays examining the relationship between war and eugenics. 
The first post in our ""Remembering The Great War"" series comes from the September 1914 issue of Popular Science, which is the first time the magazine discusses the war in Europe. In a series of essays, scientists probed various aspects of war, and came down strongly in favor of peace. “Everywhere the energies of men are diverted from scientific and social progress to destruction,” we wrote. Essay topics included the futility of war as a means of creating peace (by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie), the (im)morality of war (by philosopher William James), and even speculations that sending a nation's fittest men to be slain in war could lead to the degeneration of society. The latter essay was authored by the noted ichthyologist, eugenicist, and peace activist David Starr Jordan, who wrote,

Those who fall in war are the young men of the nations, the men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, without blemish so far as may be—the men of courage, alertness, dash and recklessness, the men who value their lives as naught in the service of the nation. The man who is left is for better and for worse the reverse of all this, and it is he who determines what the future of the nation shall be.

(For context: Eugenics, or the idea that societies could improve themselves by weeding out people who are  genetically ""less fit"", was a concept that was accepted by many scientists in the early 1900s. The idea later lost steam as scientists realized that harmful mutations are naturally introduced into the population all the time ... and after forced sterilizations, euthanization, and mass murder made eugenics seem a lot less beneficent.)
The most compelling essay from the September 1914, excerpted below, was written by psychologist James McKeen Cattell (originally in 1912, and republished for this issue) and explores the relationship between war and science.
Science And The International Good Will
By James McKeen Cattell for Popular Science, April 1912. Republished September 1914.
Science with its applications has been one of the principal factors leading to peace and international good will. Science, democracy and the limitation of warfare are the great achievements of modern civilization. They have advanced together almost continuously from the beginnings of the universities of Bologna, Paris and Oxford in the twelfth century to their great triumphs in the nineteenth century and the present promise of their complete supremacy. It may be urged reasonably that science is the true cause of democracy and that science and democracy together are the influences most conducive to permanent and universal peace.
The applications of science in industry, agriculture and commerce, in the prevention of disease and of premature death, have abolished the need of excessive manual labor. It long ago became unnecessary for the great majority of the people to be held in bondage in order that a few free citizens might have education and opportunity, and slavery has been gradually driven from the world. The vast progress of scientific discovery and invention in the nineteenth century has reduced to a moderate amount the daily labor required from each in order that all may be adequately fed, clothed and housed. The death-rate has been decreased to one half; the ensuing lower birth-rate has freed nearly half the time of women and reduced proportionately the labor of men. The period of childhood and youth may be devoted to universal education, and equality of opportunity can be given to all. It is no longer needful to depend on a privileged class to conduct the affairs of government and to supply men of performance. Those selected from all the people as most fit can be given the preparation and opportunity needed to enable them to become leaders, and every one can take an intelligent share in political affairs and in appreciation of the higher things of life.
Science is the true cause of democracy, and science and democracy together are the influences most conducive to permanent and universal peace.
In giving us democracy science has made its greatest contribution to the limitation of warfare. It must be admitted that a democratic people may be inflamed into a mob mad for war; but this is not likely to happen in the case of a war of policy or of aggression. In the past wars have been more often due to the ambitions, difficulties and intrigues of kings and princes than to the passions of the people, and the decrease of wars has been largely a result of the establishment of constitutional governments and of the legalization of the methods of conscription and taxation. If a declaration of war or an ultimatum leading to war were subject to a referendum, the vote being taken not too promptly, and if the estimated cost of the war were collected in taxes in advance, there would not be many wars.
We are still far from having a true political and social democracy. The production of wealth has increased rapidly; but we have not learned to distribute it justly or to use it wisely. The education supplied by our schools is inadequate and inept. We may be confident that a complete democracy will be the strongest force for peace that the world has seen. Even now the great mass of the people, most of them having some education and some property, are the true guarantees against wanton war. A king can no longer summon his nobles and the chiefs gather together their retainers to invade a foreign country. A war which, with' its accompanying pestilence and famine, would reduce the population of a country to one half, as in the case of the thirty years' war, is now almost inconceivable. And this we owe to social and political democracy, which in turn we owe to science.
As a result of scientific progress and invention, the law of Malthus has been reversed. The means of subsistence increase more rapidly than the population. The sinister voluntary limitation of childbirth, which may give rise to racial deterioration and actual depopulation, is unnecessary. As population increases under a given condition of culture, the number of men of genius and talent competent to make the labor of each more efficient increases in proportion; as their inventions are of benefit to all, the means of subsistence tend to increase as the square of the population. As the level of education and culture is raised, and as democracy is perfected, so that each is given opportunity to do the work for which he is fit, the wealth and means of subsistence increase still more rapidly. The law of Malthus and the law of diminishing returns, like the law of the degradation of energy, may ultimately prevail, but not in any future with which we are concerned. The population of a civilized country, in which science is cultivated, need not be limited by famine, pestilence or war. Over-population and the need of expansion by conquest are obviated by democracy and science; the cause of war which may be regarded as inevitable and legitimate is thus abolished. In providing adequately for the subsistence of an increasing population, science has made a contribution to peace the magnitude of which cannot be easily overstated.

Another great service for peace to be credited to science is the development of commerce, travel and intercommunication. Steam and electricity are handmaids of peace. Trade disputes and the misadventures of missionaries, travelers and immigrants may serve as causes or pretexts of wars, but the balance of commerce, travel and immigration is large on the side of peace. With the existing commerce among the nations, each dependent on every other, a war of any kind does injury to all. A nation at war destroys its own property throughout the world, and all the nations suffer. A neutral nation can no more afford to countenance a needless war than mobs burning its own cities and killing its own citizens. In New York, London, Berlin and Paris are business houses and representatives of every country in the world. How could any nation wish to destroy or to permit the destruction of these cities? . . .

Science has given us democracy, it has given us ample means of subsistence, it has given us commerce and intercommunication, and these three achievements are the principal factors which have lessened warfare and will eventually lead to its complete abolition. Other contributions of science, though less momentous, are by no means unimportant. Warfare is now in large measure applied science, and this tends towards its decrease. Wars between nations with scientific equipment and savage and barbarous peoples are no longer waged on equal terms and are of short duration. The extermination, despoliation and subjugation of the non-Caucasian races may be the world's great tragedy, and in so far as some of these peoples are able to adopt our science there will be a readjustment which may be written in blood or may be a triumph of common sense and justice. However this may be, the invincibility that science has conferred on the western nations has made them safe from attack and invasion, and while it may on occasion have led to wanton aggression, it has, on the whole, limited warfare. If we call to mind the centuries of invasion and threats of invasion by North-men, Ottomans and Saracens, we can appreciate the value of the means of defense which science has given to the civilized nations.
The invincibility that science has conferred on the Western nations has made them safe from attack and invasion, and while it may on occasion have led to wanton aggression, it has, on the whole, limited warfare.
The making of warfare an applied science by the western nations and by one eastern nation has tended also to prevent war between nations so equipped. When war is a game of skill rather than of chance, it is likely to be' undertaken only after careful consideration of the conditions and consequences. The cost is enormous and must be carefully weighed. The interests of the money lenders are usually on the side of peace and become increasingly so as war continues. If war does occur between two great nations it is likely to be of short duration. It can not drag on through tens of years as formerly. Its horrors are also reduced; non-combatants are not so much concerned, and soldiers suffer less from disease—far more dreadful than violence—owing to the shorter duration of wars and to hygiene, medicine and surgery. It may be hoped that science has accomplished, on the whole, more for defense than for aggression; torpedoes, mines, submarines and aeroplanes are more effective for protection than for attack. The cost of modern armaments is so immense that this in itself will lead to their limitation and to the settlement of difficulties otherwise than by appeal to arms.
There is a psychological aspect of modern scientific warfare, which tends to discredit it. The heroism and the bravery, the excitement of personal contact and the exhibition of personal prowess, the romance and the occasional chivalry, are largely gone. Men cooped up in battleships or displayed like pawns on the field are not much greater heroes to themselves or to others than workers in a mine exposed to nearly equal danger. Officers under constant instructions from the seat of government and telegraphing their orders from a point of safety fall to the level of ordinary men of affairs. Tin soldiers will not forever stir the imagination of children in the nursery. Providence is on the side favored by the money lenders and having the best organized commissariat. War becomes brutal and disgusting; at its best like the business of the hangman, at its worst like infanticide.

    Cancer vs. Organoid  

    Slides of a patient’s tumor (right) and of an organoid made from that tumor (left).  

    Dr. Yu Chen  

When it comes to treating cancer, all tumors are not created equal. Within every cancer type – whether it be in the bone or the breast – each patient has a unique set of mutations that cause their cells to be cancerous. That means therapies need to be personally tailored to each individual in order to be most effective.
Hoping to make this kind of personalized medicine a reality, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have successfully grown six functioning prostate cancer ‘organoids’ outside the body. Derived from biopsies of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, the tiny organic 3-D structures are comprised of thousands of cells, grouped together and organized like an organ. Their tissues are also highly similar to the biopsy samples from which they came, making them almost like tiny replicas of prostate cancer in a petri dish. The researchers hope to use these organoids as tools for testing new cancer drugs in the future.
They're almost like tiny replicas of prostate cancer in a petri dish.
According to Dr. Yu Chen, the lead researcher on the project, organoids are relatively new to medicine but are proving to be promising for research, as they mimic human organs. “We have all different kinds of cells in our body, but within each organ, there are also multiple cell types,” Chen, an assistant attending physician at MSK, tells Popular Science. In the lab, organoids continuously generate these different cells, just on a much smaller scale.
Chen says that with his lab's cancer organoids, the cells are a bit more monotonous, since the cells in a tumor are mostly the same. However, each cancer organoid is unique from one another, containing the distinct mutations from each patient’s cancer.
Now the idea is to create a whole lot of these tiny prostate cancer organoids, to determine which medicines work best for different subsets of patients. “If we have the mutations from a large number of patients, this will help us discover which mutations correlate to drug sensitivity or drug resistance in the laboratory,” Chen says, who noted that the organoids could be used to test multiple drugs at the same time.
Meanwhile, experts predict that more and more patients will have their cancer genomes sequenced in the future, revealing which mutations are turning their cells against them.  And with the information gleaned from organoid testing, researchers will be able to know which mutations respond better to certain treatments, making therapy options a lot more personal.
The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell.

To combat this, the UK Design Council recently launched the Inclusive Design Hub to highlight the advantages and importance of incorporating inclusive design principles. The video highlights several triumphs of inclusive design, including the Ford Focus, in which designers mimicked the challenges that older people face while driving a car, then included their findings into the final design. The point, they urge, is to not design for a checklist, but to empathize with the full spectrum of potential users. As the University of Cambridge’s “Inclusive design toolkit” site states, “Every design decision has the potential to include or exclude customers. Inclusive design emphasizes the contribution that understanding user diversity makes to informing these... keep reading

We started the project by carefully selecting a journalist who could source the information impartially and responsibly. Natalya Stanko rose to the challenge and brought an educated foundation to build the research on top of. Visually’s own Jess Bachman worked closely with her to categorize and come up with a visual language to organize all the offenses deemed worthy of death. In the graphic we have surfaced many prescriptions of the death penalty across numerous religious texts and group them into related capital vices.

With the vast majority of marketers using content to build their brands, it’s no wonder marketers are expanding the ways their content gets delivered. Experiential marketing is nothing new – from billboards to sandwich boards, brands have a history of engaging consumers outside their homes. In recent years, however, out-of-home media spend has been among the fastest-growing categories – global spend is expected to exceed $40Bn by 2018, according to PWC. The large canvas, the emergence of digitally powered signage, and the hyper-local nature of outdoor advertising have all contributed to the growth. Still, while the format may be known, today’s top marketers are innovating they way they use experiential marketing to tell their brand stories. Connect your experiences. Like all digital campaigns, the best ones move seamlessly across screens, formats, and platforms. When... keep reading

|>>Metrico: The Infographic Inspired Video Game|>>,|>>http://blog.visual.ly/metrico-infographic-inspired-game/|>>,"|>>Video games have had data visualizations built into them for a long time. They are there to provide the players with information about what is going on in the game, or post-game statistics. In Roller Coaster Tycoon for example, the data visualizations helped players make informed decisions about roller coaster design, or track park expenditures and balance their budget. This approach helps players to get better at the game and provides some interesting interfaces for players to explore. Digital Dreams has taken a different approach to integrating data visualizations with Metrico. They have built a game set entirely in an infographic world. The puzzle platformer looks a little bit like what an infographic designer’s dreams (or maybe nightmares) must look like when they have an impending deadline. The game is based on a simple principle: player movements can also cause changes in the game level. For example, jumping multiple times... keep reading

I’m here to talk about interactive graphics – the cool new kids on the block when it comes to visual content – and why they’re the next big thing in content marketing. What makes an Inter-ACTIVE? Interactive graphics, or ‘interactives’ for short, are like the Transformers of visual content: They can take on a variety of forms. You can find an interactive that’s a microsite, dashboard, or a map, to name a few. But at the core, they’re all visualizations that allow viewers to explore the information presented for themselves. By definition, interactives engage viewers in a very active way – and that engagement can be incredibly powerful to marketers.

The study split its sample of organizations using content marketing into two groups: ‘leaders’ – the top 35% most effective companies – and ‘followers’ – the bottom 65%. The link between content marketing success and content marketing measurement is far from a coincidence. Measurement is a must. Using data and metrics to gauge marketing success is far from a new idea. However, it is a bit more involved when it comes to content marketing, which can include social media content, native advertising content, and custom-created visual content such as Infographics, Motion Graphics, and Micro-content. The key is to not only measure, but to do it right. In... keep reading
